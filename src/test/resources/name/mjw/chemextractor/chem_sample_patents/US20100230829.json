The singular forms “a”, “an” and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. The term “electroactive” as used herein refers to a material that is (1) capable of transporting, blocking or storing charge (either positive charge or negative charge), (2) light-absorbing or light emitting, typically although not necessarily fluorescent, and/or (3) useful in photo-induced charge generation, and/or 4) of changing color, reflectivity, transmittance upon application of bias. An “electroactive device” is a device comprising an electroactive material. In the present context an electroactive layer is a layer for an electroactive device, which comprises at least one electroactive organic material or at least one electrode material. As used herein the term “organic material” may refer to either small molecular organic compounds, or high molecular organic compounds, including but not limited to dendrimers, or large molecular polymers, including oligomers with a number of repeat unit ranging from 2 to 10, and polymers with a number of repeat unit greater than 10.\n    As used herein, the term “activator material” refers to materials that enable increase in charge injection, in charge transport, in charge recombination, or in charge separation. In some embodiments, the activator materials are hole or electron donors. Examples of activator materials include but are not limited to photoacids (or interchangeably photogenerated acids) and photobases (or interchangeably photogenerated bases).\n    As used herein, the term “activated layer” refers to a layer with at least one activator material. In a non-limiting example, an activated layer includes a photoacid or a photobase. In a further example, a layer with hole donors, a p-activated layer, may be expected to experience an increase in work function as compared a layer without the activator material, whereas a layer with electron donors, a n-activated layer, is expected to experience a decrease in work function compared to a layer without the activator material.\n    As used herein, the term “latent activator material” refers to materials whose activation products comprise at least one activator material. Examples of latent activator materials include but are not limited to photoacid generators and photobase generators.\n    As used herein, the term “latent activated layer” refers to a layer with at least one latent activator material. In a non-limiting example, a latent activated layer is a charge transport layer comprising poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) tetramethacrylate (PEDOT) material further including a latent activator material such as diphenyliodonium hexafluorphosphate.\n    As used herein, the term “activation” refers to using light or heat to generate an activator material.\n    As used herein, the term “activation products” refers to direct or indirect reactions products due to thermal or photo activation of a latent activator material. For example, a photoacid is the activation product of a photoactivated photoacid generator latent activator material.\n    As used herein, the term “passivation” refers to inactivating an activated region in a layer, by irradiating a latent activator material in contact with the activated region, to provide counter activator material to neutralize the activator material in the activated region. For example, a base material can be neutralized by bringing into contact with the base material a latent activator material such as a photoacid generator, and activating the photoacid generator to release the photoacid to neutralize the base material.\n    As used herein, the term “disposed over” or “deposited over” refers to disposed or deposited immediately on top of and in contact with, or disposed or deposited on top of but with intervening layers therebetween.\n    The term “alkyl” as used in the various embodiments of the present invention is intended to designate linear alkyl, branched alkyl, aralkyl, cycloalkyl, bicycloalkyl, tricycloalkyl and polycycloalkyl radicals comprising carbon and hydrogen atoms, and optionally containing atoms in addition to carbon and hydrogen, for example atoms selected from Groups 15, 16 and 17 of the Periodic Table. Alkyl groups may be saturated or unsaturated, and may comprise, for example, vinyl or allyl. The term “alkyl” also encompasses that alkyl portion of alkoxide groups. Unless otherwise noted, in various embodiments normal and branched alkyl radicals are those containing from 1 to about 32 carbon atoms, and comprise as illustrative non-limiting examples C\n    1-C\n    32alkyl (optionally substituted with one or more groups selected from C\n    1-C\n    32alkyl, C\n    3-C\n    15cycloalkyl or aryl); and C\n    3-C\n    15cycloalkyl optionally substituted with one or more groups selected from C\n    1-C\n    32alkyl or aryl.

A mixture solution (referred to as PEDOT-TMA:Ph\n    2IPF\n    6) of PEDOT-TMA and Ph\n    2IPF\n    6was prepared by mixing 2 gram PEDOT-TMA in propylene carbonate with 100 milligram Ph\n    2IPF\n    6in 1.5 milliliter propylene carbonate.\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n              \n                TABLE 1\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n              \n              \n                Experimental results of Kelvin probe (KP) measurements\n              \n              \n                of contact potential difference (CPD)\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                CPD\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                \n                Average of 20\n                Standard\n              \n              \n                Sample\n                Sample structures\n                data points\n                deviation\n              \n              \n                \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                Sample 1\n                ITO (as cleaned)\n                −0.275\n                0.007\n              \n              \n                Sample 2\n                ITO/PEDOT-TMA\n                −0.247\n                0.006\n              \n              \n                \n                (as spin-coated)\n              \n              \n                Activated\n                ITO/PEDOT-TMA\n                −0.304\n                0.007\n              \n              \n                Sample 2\n                (UV-ozoned 5 minutes)\n              \n              \n                Sample 3\n                ITO/PEDOT-TMA:Ph\n                2IPF\n                6\n                −0.271\n                0.007\n              \n              \n                \n                (as spin-coated)\n              \n              \n                Activated\n                ITO/PEDOT-TMA:Ph\n                2IPF\n                6\n                −1.293\n                0.005\n              \n              \n                Sample 3\n                (UV-ozoned 5 minutes)\n              \n              \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    Three samples (Table 1) for the KP measurements were prepared as follows. Indium tin oxide (ITO, about 140 nanometer) coated glass obtained from Applied Films Corporation was used as a conductive substrate. Sample 1 was bare pre-cleaned ITO, Sample 2 consisted of ITO and a layer (about 40 nanometer) of PEDOT-TMA that was applied via spin-coating from its solution in propylene carbonate at a spin-speed of 4000 rpm, Sample 3 consisted of ITO and a layer (about 35 nanometer) of PEDOT-TMA:Ph\n    2IPF\n    6that was applied via spin-coating from the mixture solution at a spin-speed of 4000 rpm. KP measurements were then conducted on the samples prior to and post a ultra-violet ozone treatment. Both the UV-ozone treatment and the KP measurements (with a Ultraviolet Ozone Cleaner, Model 42, obtained from the Jelight Company, Irvine, Calif. 92618, U.S.A.) were conducted in the ambient environment with a room temperature of about 24° C. and a relative humidity of about 64%.\n    As can be seen from the results listed in Table 1, introducing PEDOT-TMA did not cause significant changes in CPD (and equivalently, the effective work function) of the ITO substrate, regardless of whether the PEDOT-TMA was UV-ozone treated (Activated Sample 2) or not (Sample 2). Similarly, the presence of PEDOT-TMA:Ph\n    2IPF\n    6, as spin-coated (Sample 3) did not significantly alter the measured CPD. However, a significant reduction in CPD (equivalently, increase in effective work function) was observed after the PEDOT-TMA:Ph\n    2IPF\n    6mixture layer was UV-ozone treated.\n    EXAMPLE 2\n    Six OLED devices were fabricated. The OLEDs consisted of a blue light-emitting polymer (LEP), ADS329BE [poly(9,9-dioctylfluoenyl-2,7-diyl)—end capped with N,N-Bis(4-methylphenyl)-aniline], obtained from American Dye Sources, Inc, Canada, and used as received without any further purification, as the emissive layer material.\n    The OLEDs were fabricated as follows. ITO coated glass, patterned using standard photolithography techniques, was used as the anode substrate. The OLEDs employ an ITO anode with and without an additional anode-activation layer but otherwise the same structure. As shown in the Table 2, both device A and device B had the same ITO anode except that the ITO substrate in device B was further UV-ozoned for 5 minutes prior to the application of ADS329BE. Devices C and D had the same anode-activation layer of PEDOT-TMA (about 40 to 45 nanometer) except that the PEDOT-TMA layer in the device D was further UV-ozoned for about 5 minutes prior to the application of ADS329BE. Both device E and F had the same anode-activation layer (about 35 nanometer) of PEDOT-TMA:Ph\n    2IPF\n    6except that the PEDOT-TMA:Ph\n    2IPF\n    6layer in the device F was further UV-ozoned for about 5 minutes prior to the application of ADS329BE. Next, a layer (65±3 nanometer) of ADS329BE was spin-coated from its solution (1.7 wt %) in p-xylene atop of the ITO with and without the anode-activation layers. Application of the anode-activation layers and the ADS329BE layer as well as UV-ozone treatments were all conducted in the ambient environment with a room temperature of 24° C. and a relative humidity of 64%. Then the samples were transferred into a glovebox filled with Argon (moisture and oxygen was less than about 1 ppm and about 10 ppm, respectively). Next, a NaF(4 nanometer)/Al (110 nanometer) bilayer cathode was then thermally-evaporated atop of the ADS329 emissive layer. After metallization (metallization refers to disposing metal layers such as aluminum to electrically connect or interconnect various device structures), the devices were encapsulated with a cover glass sealed with an optical adhesive Norland 68 obtained from Norland products, Inc, Cranbury, N.J. 08512, USA. The active area was about 0.2 cm\n    2.\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n              \n                TABLE 2\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n              \n              \n                Measured performance charcteristics of the OLED Devices\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                \n                At a fixed current density\n              \n              \n                \n                Turn-on\n                of 10 mA/cm\n                2\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                voltage\n                Voltage\n                Efficiency\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                Device\n                Anode/Anode-activation layer\n                (Volts)\n                (Volts)\n                cd/A\n                lm/w\n              \n              \n                \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                Device A\n                ITO (as cleaned)\n                >12.0\n                9.1\n                0.00012\n                0.000042\n              \n              \n                Device B\n                ITO (UV-ozoned 5 minutes)\n                10.1\n                9.1\n                0.002\n                0.00077\n              \n              \n                Device C\n                ITO/PEDOT-TMA (as spin-coated)\n                >12.0\n                8.4\n                0.00026\n                0.000098\n              \n              \n                Device D\n                ITO/PEDOT-TMA (UV-\n                7.4\n                7.2\n                0.0078\n                0.0034\n              \n              \n                \n                ozoned 5 mins)\n              \n              \n                Device E\n                ITO/PEDOT-TMA:Ph\n                2IPF\n                6\n                7.8\n                7.4\n                0.005\n                0.0020\n              \n              \n                \n                (as spin-coated)\n              \n              \n                Device F\n                ITO/PEDOT-TMA:Ph\n                2IPF\n                6\n                3.5\n                4.6\n                0.4\n                0.27\n              \n              \n                \n                (UV-ozoned 5 minutes)\n              \n              \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    Measured performance characteristics of the devices is summarized in Table 2. It can be seen that the use of UV-ozone treated PEDOT-TMA:Ph\n    2IPF\n    6anode-activation layer yielded an OLED device with significantly enhanced efficiency and much-lowered turn-on voltage (defined as the applied voltage when the corresponding brightness has reached 1 cd/m2) relative to the devices having either a bare ITO anode or with the PEDOT-TMA anode-activation layer. Since all devices share the same type of emissive layer as well as the same type of bilayer cathode, the enhancement in performance can be attributed to the fact that the ITO electrode had been activated by the PEDOT-TMA: Ph\n    2IPF\n    6, leading to much enhanced hole-injection. The measured performance characteristics indicate that the presence of Ph\n    2IPF\n    6and the UV-ozone treatment are the key factors contributing to the observed activation effect.\n    Although the applicants do not wish to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that upon UV irradiation (and/or other latent means), Ph\n    2IPF\n    6, widely known as a photoacid generator, decomposes and generates a strong acid (HPF\n    6) and the (photo)-generated acid is able to activate the PEDOT-TMA host and most likely the PEDOT-TMA:Ph\n    2IPF\n    6/LEP interface as well, thus resulting in much enhanced hole-injection from the ITO electrode into the active LEP layer and, subsequently, the overall performance\n    EXAMPLE 3\n    A 2 liter, 3-neck flask was charged with Adogen 464 (about 23 grams), 2-bromo-propane (about 235 milliliter), potassium hydroxide (saturated, aq, about 1.2 liter), and freshly cracked and distilled cyclopentadiene (41 milliliter). The contents were stirred with a mechanical stirrer and heated to about 80° C. for 24 hours. Gas chromatography analysis of the top layer showed excellent conversion to tetra-isopropylcyclopentadiene. The entire reaction mixture was poured into a separatory funnel. Addition of water and hexanes broke up the emulsion and the top layer was collected. The bottom aqueous layer was washed with hexanes, and a total of about 1.5 liter of organic solvents was collected. The organic layer was then dried with magnesium sulfate and then filtered and washed with more hexanes. The total organics were then subjected to rotary evaporation (30 mmHg) and 80° C. to remove hexanes and leave a higher boiling oil. The oil was then subjected to vacuum distillation through a Vigreaux column, 0.6 mmHg. Fractions that boiled between 110-130° C. were collected (about 53.1 grams). The entire distillate was dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) (about 500 milliliter) and then potassium (about 10 grams) was slowly added and gas evolution was noted. The contents were stirred for 17 hours. The reaction was quenched by addition of water. The contents were extracted with hexanes, dried with magnesium sulfate and then the hexanes were removed in vacuo. The recovered oil was placed in the refrigerator to give colorless crystals, C\n    5H\n    2(i-propyl)\n    4.\n    C\n    5H\n    2(i-propyl)\n    4, as prepared above (about 8.12 grams) was combined with THF (about 100 milliliter) and potassium hydride (about 1.4 grams) and stirred for about 24 hours. The solution was filtered under nitrogen and washed with dry THF under nitrogen to give a white solid, tetra-i-propyl-cyclopentadienyl potassium (K[HC\n    5(i-propyl)\n    4]). K[HC\n    5(i-propyl)\n    4] (about 2.81 gram) was combined with barium iodide (about 2 gram) in THF (50 milliliter) and stirred for about 24 hours under nitrogen. The solution was filtered under nitrogen to remove potassium iodide and the solid was washed with THF. The THF was removed in vacuo to give a solid that contained Bis(tetra-i-propyl-cyclopentadienyl) barium (Ba-TPCP).\n    About 55.7 milligram Ba-TPCP was dissolved in about 11 milliliter of xylenes to prepare a solution with a nominal concentration of about 0.5 wt %. The solution was prepared in the glovebox filled with argon (moisture and oxygen was less than about 1 parts per million (ppm) and about 3 ppm, respectively). The solution, as prepared, had some undissolved material(s) precipitated on the bottom of the glass vial. The top clear solution was taken and used without any filtration steps.\n    Three samples, Sample 4, Sample 5 and Sample 6 were prepared for KP measurements. For all samples, a layer (about 80 nm) of Al, used as a conductive substrate, was initially thermally evaporated over a pre-cleaned glass slide.\n    KP measurements on Sample 4 were conducted on the Al substrate prior to and post exposure to the ambient environment (referred to as “air exposure”) and baking. The ambient environment refers to normal room conditions with a temperature of about 24° C. and relative humidity of about 62% when the experiments were conducted. For Sample 5, the solution of Ba-TPCP was spin-coated on top of the Al in the same glovebox. A series of KP measurements were then conducted on Sample 5, (1) as spin-coated, (2) after a step air exposure for 3 mins, (3) after a step of baking at about 180° C. for about 15 minutes in the glovebox, (4) after another air exposure for 3 minutes, (5) after another step of baking at about 180° C. for about 15 minutes in the same glovebox and (6) after another air exposure for about 3 minutes. For Sample 6, the solution of Ba-TPCP was spin-coated over the Al in the glovebox. A series of KP measurements were then conducted on Sample 6 (1) as spin-coated, (2) after a step of baking at about 180° C. for about 15 minutes in the same glovebox, (3) after air exposure for about 3 minutes.\n    Results of KP measurements are summarized in Table 3. Measurements indicate that the baking step in the glovebox is critical. The increase in CPD in response to the baking step (or the 1\n    stbaking step as for the sample A) corresponds to a significant reduction in effective work function.\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n              \n                TABLE 3\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n              \n              \n                Experimental results of Kelvin probe (KP) measurements\n              \n              \n                of contact potential difference (CPD) on Al\n              \n              \n                with and without the Ba-TPCP layer\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                CPD\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                \n                average of 20\n                standard\n              \n              \n                \n                Treatment\n                data points\n                deviation\n              \n              \n                \n                \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                SAMPLE 4\n                As prepared\n                1.372\n                0.006\n              \n              \n                Al substrate\n              \n              \n                \n                Air exposure (3 minutes)\n                1.369\n                0.006\n              \n              \n                \n                Baked at 180° C. for 15\n                1.371\n                0.007\n              \n              \n                \n                minutes\n              \n              \n                SAMPLE 5\n                As spin-coated\n                1.357\n                0.007\n              \n              \n                Al/Ba-TPCP\n              \n              \n                \n                Air exposure (3 minutes)\n                1.175\n                0.005\n              \n              \n                \n                Baked at 180° C. for 15\n                1.456\n                0.007\n              \n              \n                \n                minutes in the glovebox\n              \n              \n                \n                Air exposure (3 minutes)\n                1.055\n                0.007\n              \n              \n                \n                Baked at 180° C. for 15\n                1.123\n                0.005\n              \n              \n                \n                minutes in the glovebox\n              \n              \n                \n                Air exposure (3 minutes)\n                1.078\n                0.007\n              \n              \n                SAMPLE 6\n                as spin-coated\n                1.351\n                0.006\n              \n              \n                Al/Ba-TPCP\n              \n              \n                \n                Baked at 180° C. for 15\n                1.545\n                0.007\n              \n              \n                \n                minutes in the glovebox\n              \n              \n                \n                Air exposure (3 minutes)\n                1.013\n                0.007\n              \n              \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    EXAMPLE 4\n    Four OLED devices were fabricated. Two solutions were prepared in the same glovebox (moisture and oxygen was less than 1 ppm and 3 ppm, respectively) prior to device fabrication. The first solution (referred to OAP9903:SR454) included a green light-emitting polymer poly[(9,9-dioctylfluoren-2,7-diyl)-alt-co-(benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazol-4,7-diyl)] (OPA9903) obtained from H. W. Sands, Corporation, Jupiter, Fla. 33477, USA and an acrylate-based adhesive ethoxylated (3) trimethylolpropane triacrylate (SR454) obtained from Sartomer, Exton, Pa. 19341, USA. Both materials were used as received without any further purification. The mixture solution was prepared by mixing about 2.5 milliliter of a 2% OPA9903 solution in p-xylene with about 2 milliliter of a 1% SR454 solution in p-xylene. The resulting ratio of SR454 to OPA9903 was about 30 wt %. The second solution (referred to as OPA9903:Ba-TPCP) including OPA9903 and Ba-TPCP was prepared by mixing about 1.5 milliliter of a 0.6 wt % OPA9903 solution in xylenes with about 3 milliliter of the Ba-TPCP solution in xylenes.\n    OLEDs were fabricated as follows. Pre-patterned ITO coated glass used as the anode substrate was cleaned with UV-ozone for 10 mins. Then a layer (60 nm) of [poly(3,4)-ethylendioxythiophene/polystyrene sulfonate] (PEDOT/PSS) polymer obtained from Bayer Corporation was deposited atop the ITO via spin-coating and then baked for 1 hour at 180° C. in the ambient environment (with a room temperature of 24° C. and a relative humidity of 62%). Then the samples were transferred to the same glovebox. The following steps, unless further specified, were carried out in the same glovebox. Next, the emissive layer consisting of OPA9903:SR454 was spin-coated from its solution in p-xylene atop the PEDOT/PSS layer and then cured with a UV lamp (R-52 grid lamp, obtained from Ultroviolet Products, Upland, Calif., 91796, U.S.A. with the filter removed) (the intensity measured at about 310 nm, 365 nm and 400 nm was 0.39, 0.43 and 1.93 mW/cm\n    2) for 1 minute. Next, a layer of the mixture of OPA9903:Ba-TPCP was spin-coated atop the cured emissive layer and then baked at about 180° C. for about 15 minutes. Finally, a layer (about 110 nanometer) of Al was then thermally evaporated through a shadow mask atop of the OPA9903:Ba-TPCP layer. Following metal evaporation, the devices were encapsulated using a glass slide sealed with the optical adhesive Norland 68. The active area is about 0.2 cm\n    2.\n    Four OLED devices were made. Control device, device G, did not have the mixture layer of OPA9903:Ba-TPCP. Devices H, I and J had the same structure except that the mixture layer of OPA9903:Ba-TPCP was treated differently prior to the Al deposition. For device H, the mixture layer, as spin-coated, was exposed to the ambient environment for about 3 minutes, then baked at 180° C. for about 15 minutes in the same glovebox. For device I, the mixture layer was not exposed to the ambient environment, and for the device J, the mixture layer was exposed to the ambient environment for 3 minutes after the baking step. \n    FIG. 25shows the efficiency (measured in candela per ampere, cd/A) versus current density (measured in milliamperes per square centimeter, mA/cm\n    2) for devices G, H, J, and I.\n    Comparison of the efficiency \n    130versus current density \n    132curves indicates that introducing the mixture layer of OPA9903:Ba-TPCP as in the device H (curve \n    136), I (curve \n    140) and J (curve \n    138) significantly improves the device efficiency relative to the control device G (curve \n    134). Since all four devices share the same anode, it is believed that the observed improvement in efficiency directly reflects the activation of the bare Al cathode. Furthermore, the plots also indicate that the sequence of baking and exposure to ambient environment is important. The device I without any exposure to ambient the environment showed the greatest improvement relative to the device H and the device J. The device H that was exposed to the ambient environment prior to the baking step shows better efficiency relative to the device J that was exposed to the ambient environment post the baking step.\n    Although the Applicants do not wish to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that upon baking (and/or other latent means) the barium compound (Ba-TPCP) decomposes and releases free barium atoms that are able to, subsequently, activate the active polymer (OPA9903). Equation 5, shows an alkaline earth metal organometallic compound M-TPCP, where M is any alkaline earth metal including barium, decomposing on application of heat to release the free metal atoms.\n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    The activated OPA9903 facilitates the electron injection from the bare Al cathode into the active layer of OPA9903.\n    The previously described embodiments of the present invention have many advantages, including, providing OLED devices with greater conductivity leading to possible increases in OLED light emitting efficiencies.\n    While only certain features of the invention have been illustrated and described herein, many modifications and changes will occur to those skilled in the art. It is, therefore, to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the invention.","lang":"en"}],"assignees":[{"state":"NY","city":"Schenectady","name":"GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY","upper_name":"GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY","country":"US","number":1}],"titles":[{"text":"ORGANIC LIGHT EMITTING DEVICES HAVING LATENT ACTIVATED LAYERS AND METHODS OF FABRICATING THE SAME","lang":"en"}],"govt_interest":[{"lang":"en"}],"data_source":"USPTO","id":"US20100230829","drawing_description":[{"text":"DRAWINGS\n      These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become better understood when the following detailed description is read with reference to the accompanying drawings in which like characters represent like parts throughout the drawings, wherein:\n      \n      FIG. 1is a cross-sectional representation of an exemplary embodiment of an organic light emitting device, according to aspects of the present technique;\n      \n      FIG. 2is a cross-sectional representation of another exemplary embodiment of an organic light emitting device, according to aspects of the present technique;\n      \n      FIG. 3is a cross-sectional representation of another exemplary embodiment of an organic light emitting device, according to aspects of the present technique;\n      \n      FIG. 4is a cross-sectional representation of another exemplary embodiment of an organic light emitting device, according to aspects of the present technique;\n      \n      FIG. 5is a cross-sectional representation of another exemplary embodiment of an organic light emitting device, according to aspects of the present technique;\n      \n      FIG. 6is a cross-sectional representation of another exemplary embodiment of an organic light emitting device, according to aspects of the present technique;\n      \n      FIGS. 7-22are cross-sectional representations of exemplary processes of fabricating organic light emitting devices illustrated in \n      FIGS. 1-6, according to aspects of the present technique;\n      \n      FIG. 23is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary process of fabricating the organic light emitting device according to aspects of the present technique;\n      \n      FIG. 24is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary process of fabricating the organic light emitting device according to aspects of the present technique;\n      \n      FIG. 25is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary process of fabricating the organic light emitting device according to aspects of the present technique;\n      \n      FIG. 26is a graph illustrating the efficiency versus current density profiles of organic light emitting devices according to aspects of the present technique.","lang":"en"}],"pub_date":"2010/09/16","patent_type":"Utility","summary":[{"lang":"en"}],"related_documents":[{"type":"division","doc_number":"US12787911","country":"US"},{"type":"division","date":"2005/10/04","doc_number":"US11243194","country":"US"}],"abstracts":[{"text":"An organic light emitting device with a latent activator material is presented.

The Government has certain rights in the invention.\n    \n    BACKGROUND\n    The invention relates generally to organic electronic devices. The invention in particular relates to organic light emitting devices.\n    Organic electronic devices include organic light emitting devices and organic photovoltaic devices. Organic electronic devices operate by injection of charges, which combine to result in radiation of energy as in a light emitting device, or separation of charges as in a photovoltaic device. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, an organic light emitting device (OLED) typically includes at least one organic layer sandwiched between two electrodes. The OLED may include additional layers such as a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, an emissive layer, and an electron transport layer. Upon application of an appropriate voltage to the OLED, the injected positive and negative charges recombine in the emissive layer to produce light.\n    The addition of certain materials in the device can facilitate charge injection, transport, recombination, separation, etc. In some examples, such addition of materials may lead to increase in conductivity in a system or device by increasing the number of charge carriers (electrons or holes) present in the system. Traditional approaches include such processes as addition of acidic compounds (addition of hole donors or electron acceptors) and reducing materials like metal fluorides, alkali or alkali earth metals (addition of electron donors). The reactive nature of these materials can cause problem when forming multi-layer devices. For example, strong acids present in a layer typically migrate upon addition of layers to the top of the layer. Furthermore, known electron donors typically react with air or moisture and may decompose during manufacture.\n    Accordingly, a technique is needed to address one or more of the foregoing problems in organic optoelectronic devices, such as light emitting devices.\n    BRIEF DESCRIPTION\n    Briefly, in accordance with aspects of the present technique, an organic light emitting device is presented. The organic light emitting device includes a substrate and at least one layer including a latent activator material.\n    In accordance with further aspects of the present technique, an organic light emitting device is presented. The organic light emitting device includes a substrate and at least one layer including activation products of a latent activator material.\n    According to further aspects of the present technique, a method of fabricating an organic light emitting device with a latent activator material or with activation products of a latent activator material is presented.\n    \n    \n      DRAWINGS\n      These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become better understood when the following detailed description is read with reference to the accompanying drawings in which like characters represent like parts throughout the drawings, wherein:\n      \n      FIG. 1is a cross-sectional representation of an exemplary embodiment of an organic light emitting device, according to aspects of the present technique;\n      \n      FIG. 2is a cross-sectional representation of another exemplary embodiment of an organic light emitting device, according to aspects of the present technique;\n      \n      FIG. 3is a cross-sectional representation of another exemplary embodiment of an organic light emitting device, according to aspects of the present technique;\n      \n      FIG. 4is a cross-sectional representation of another exemplary embodiment of an organic light emitting device, according to aspects of the present technique;\n      \n      FIG. 5is a cross-sectional representation of another exemplary embodiment of an organic light emitting device, according to aspects of the present technique;\n      \n      FIG. 6is a cross-sectional representation of another exemplary embodiment of an organic light emitting device, according to aspects of the present technique;\n      \n      FIGS. 7-22are cross-sectional representations of exemplary processes of fabricating organic light emitting devices illustrated in \n      FIGS. 1-6, according to aspects of the present technique;\n      \n      FIG. 23is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary process of fabricating the organic light emitting device according to aspects of the present technique;\n      \n      FIG. 24is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary process of fabricating the organic light emitting device according to aspects of the present technique;\n      \n      FIG. 25is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary process of fabricating the organic light emitting device according to aspects of the present technique;\n      \n      FIG. 26is a graph illustrating the efficiency versus current density profiles of organic light emitting devices according to aspects of the present technique.\n    \n    \n    In the following specification and the claims which follow, reference will be made to a number of terms which shall be defined to have the following meanings. The singular forms “a”, “an” and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. The term “electroactive” as used herein refers to a material that is (1) capable of transporting, blocking or storing charge (either positive charge or negative charge), (2) light-absorbing or light emitting, typically although not necessarily fluorescent, and/or (3) useful in photo-induced charge generation, and/or 4) of changing color, reflectivity, transmittance upon application of bias. An “electroactive device” is a device comprising an electroactive material. In the present context an electroactive layer is a layer for an electroactive device, which comprises at least one electroactive organic material or at least one electrode material. As used herein the term “organic material” may refer to either small molecular organic compounds, or high molecular organic compounds, including but not limited to dendrimers, or large molecular polymers, including oligomers with a number of repeat unit ranging from 2 to 10, and polymers with a number of repeat unit greater than 10.\n    As used herein, the term “activator material” refers to materials that enable increase in charge injection, in charge transport, in charge recombination, or in charge separation. In some embodiments, the activator materials are hole or electron donors. Examples of activator materials include but are not limited to photoacids (or interchangeably photogenerated acids) and photobases (or interchangeably photogenerated bases).\n    As used herein, the term “activated layer” refers to a layer with at least one activator material. In a non-limiting example, an activated layer includes a photoacid or a photobase. In a further example, a layer with hole donors, a p-activated layer, may be expected to experience an increase in work function as compared a layer without the activator material, whereas a layer with electron donors, a n-activated layer, is expected to experience a decrease in work function compared to a layer without the activator material.\n    As used herein, the term “latent activator material” refers to materials whose activation products comprise at least one activator material. Examples of latent activator materials include but are not limited to photoacid generators and photobase generators.\n    As used herein, the term “latent activated layer” refers to a layer with at least one latent activator material. In a non-limiting example, a latent activated layer is a charge transport layer comprising poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) tetramethacrylate (PEDOT) material further including a latent activator material such as diphenyliodonium hexafluorphosphate.\n    As used herein, the term “activation” refers to using light or heat to generate an activator material.\n    As used herein, the term “activation products” refers to direct or indirect reactions products due to thermal or photo activation of a latent activator material. For example, a photoacid is the activation product of a photoactivated photoacid generator latent activator material.\n    As used herein, the term “passivation” refers to inactivating an activated region in a layer, by irradiating a latent activator material in contact with the activated region, to provide counter activator material to neutralize the activator material in the activated region. For example, a base material can be neutralized by bringing into contact with the base material a latent activator material such as a photoacid generator, and activating the photoacid generator to release the photoacid to neutralize the base material.\n    As used herein, the term “disposed over” or “deposited over” refers to disposed or deposited immediately on top of and in contact with, or disposed or deposited on top of but with intervening layers therebetween.\n    The term “alkyl” as used in the various embodiments of the present invention is intended to designate linear alkyl, branched alkyl, aralkyl, cycloalkyl, bicycloalkyl, tricycloalkyl and polycycloalkyl radicals comprising carbon and hydrogen atoms, and optionally containing atoms in addition to carbon and hydrogen, for example atoms selected from Groups 15, 16 and 17 of the Periodic Table. Alkyl groups may be saturated or unsaturated, and may comprise, for example, vinyl or allyl. The term “alkyl” also encompasses that alkyl portion of alkoxide groups. Unless otherwise noted, in various embodiments normal and branched alkyl radicals are those containing from 1 to about 32 carbon atoms, and comprise as illustrative non-limiting examples C\n    1-C\n    32alkyl (optionally substituted with one or more groups selected from C\n    1-C\n    32alkyl, C\n    3-C\n    15cycloalkyl or aryl); and C\n    3-C\n    15cycloalkyl optionally substituted with one or more groups selected from C\n    1-C\n    32alkyl or aryl. Some illustrative, non-limiting examples comprise methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tertiary-butyl, pentyl, neopentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl and dodecyl. Some particular illustrative non-limiting examples of cycloalkyl and bicycloalkyl radicals comprise cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, methylcyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, bicycloheptyl and adamantyl. In various embodiments aralkyl radicals comprise those containing from 7 to about 14 carbon atoms; these include, but are not limited to, benzyl, phenylbutyl, phenylpropyl, and phenylethyl. The term “aryl” as used in the various embodiments of the present invention is intended to designate substituted or unsubstituted aryl radicals comprising from 6 to 20 ring carbon atoms. Some illustrative non-limiting examples of aryl radicals include C\n    6-C\n    20aryl optionally substituted with one or more groups selected from C\n    1-C\n    32alkyl, C\n    3-C\n    15cycloalkyl, aryl, and functional groups comprising atoms selected from Groups 15, 16 and 17 of the Periodic Table. Some particular illustrative, non-limiting examples of aryl radicals comprise substituted or unsubstituted phenyl, biphenyl, tolyl, xylyl, naphthyl and binaphthyl.\n    In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention there is provided an organic light emitting device comprising at least one latent activated layer including at least one latent activator material.

The metal acts as an electron donor.\n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    In some embodiments, the latent activated layer comprises 100% by weight of the latent activator materials. In certain other embodiments, the latent activator material is present in a range from about 99% to 0.1% by weight of the latent activated layer. In other embodiments, the latent activator material is present in a range from about 90% to about 20% of the latent activated layer. In still further embodiments, the latent activator material is present in a range from about 90% to about 50% of the latent activated layer. In some other embodiments the latent activator material may be present in a quantity as low as 100 parts per million of the total latent activated layer composition.\n    Non-limiting examples of photoacid generators include onium salts, iodonium salts, sulphonium salts, oxonium salts, halonium salts, phosphonium salts, nitrobenzyl esters, sulfones, phosphates, N-hydroxyimidosulfonates, a diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate, a diazonaphthoquinone, a diphenyliodonium triflate, a diphenyliodonium p-toluenesulfonate, triarylsulfonium sulfonates, a (p-methylphenyl, p-isopropylphenyl)iodonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, a bis(isopropylphenyl)iodonium hexafluoroantimonate, a bis(n-dodecylphenyl)iodonium hexafluoroantimonate and like materials.\n    Examples of thermoacid generators include but not are not limited to thiolanium salts, benzylthiolanium hexafluoro-propane-sulfonate, nitrobenzyl ester, 2-nitrobenzyl tosylate, amine triflates, iodonium salts, combination of iodonium salts with free radical generator such as benzopinacol, iodonium salts in combination with metal salts and like materials.\n    Non-limiting examples of photobase generators include O-acyloxime, quartenary ammonium salts, O-phenylacetyl-2-acetonaphthone oxime, benzoyloxycarbonyl derivatives, O-nitrobenzyl N-cyclohexylcarbamate, nifedipine, a N-methylnifedipine and like materials.\n    In another embodiment of the present invention, the latent activator material comprises an organometallic compound, which on thermal or optical activation releases the metal in its zero oxidation state.

Spatially selective activation enables patterning of the organic light emitting device. Non-limiting examples of thermal activation include placing the device with the latent activated layer on a hot plate or using a light source such as a laser source to selectively heat certain regions of the layer with the latent activated material. The heat energy absorbed by the latent activator material leads to the release of an activator material.

The latent activator material, upon absorption of light, is photo-initiated to release the activator material.\n    In certain other embodiments of the present invention, the organic light emitting device includes at least one latent counter activator material in contact with a activated region. By irradiating a latent activator material in contact with the activated region, to provide counter activators to neutralize the donors in the activated region, the activated region can be passivated. For example, by irradiating a latent photobase generator in contact with a p-activated region, electron donors will be released to neutralize the hole donors in the activated region. Spatially selective passivation can also enable patterning of the OLED device.\n    In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the organic light emitting device includes at least one activated layer, wherein the layer comprises photo or thermal activation products of at least one latent charge-donor material.

The activated layer may include photo-activation products at more than one wavelength. The OLED may further include a substrate layer such as but not limited to polymeric substrates.\n    In some embodiments the activated layer comprises 100% by weight of the activator material. In certain other embodiments, the activator materials are present in a range from about 99% to 1% by weight of the activated layer. In other embodiments, the activator materials are present in a range from about 90% to about 20% of the activated layer composition. In still further embodiments the activator materials are present in a range from about 90% to about 50% of the activated layer. In some other embodiments the activator material may be present in a quantity as low as 100 parts per million of the total activated layer composition.\n    In some embodiments of the present invention, the organic light emitting device is patterned. The patterns may be regular, such as, but not limited to, alphabets, numerals and geometrical structures. The patterns may also be arbitrary and irregular. Patterning of the OLED device is enabled by photo or thermal induced spatially selective activation. Spatially selective activation is achieved using a pre-machined mask, negative film, or any other means.\n    In certain other embodiments of the present invention, patterning can also be achieved by spatially selective passivation. Selective passivation comprises de-activation by selectively irradiating a counter charge-donor material in contact with a activated region.\n    Referring to \n    FIG. 3, another exemplary embodiment of a light emitting device \n    30is illustrated. In the illustrated embodiment, the light emitting device \n    30is shown to include a first electrode \n    32, a selectively activated electroactive layer \n    33with activated regions \n    34including photo or thermal activation products of at least one latent charge-donor material, and non-activated regions \n    36with at least one latent activator material. The device further includes an additional organic electroactive layer \n    38and a second electrode \n    40. In the selectively activated layer \n    33, only certain parts or sections of the layer are selectively activated, while certain sections are left either with the latent activator material or the regions could be deactivated or passivated. This selective activation enables patterning of the OLED. The patterning could include regular shapes, such as but not limited to alphabets or numbers or geometrical patterns or any combinations thereof and could also include arbitrary shapes and patterns.\n    In the illustrated embodiment shown in \n    FIG. 4, the light emitting device \n    42includes a first electrode \n    44, a first activated layer \n    46with photo or thermal activation products of at least one latent activator material, a second activated layer \n    48with photo or thermal activation products of at least one latent activator material and a second electrode \n    50.

Non-limiting examples of anode materials include, but are not limited to, indium tin oxide (ITO), tin oxide, indium oxide, zinc oxide, indium zinc oxide, nickel, gold, and like materials, and mixtures thereof.\n    Non limiting examples of substrates include thermoplastic polymer, poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(ethylene naphthalate), polyethersulfone, polycarbonate, polyimide, acrylate, polyolefin, glass, metal, and like materials, and combinations thereof.\n    Organic light emitting devices of the present invention may include additional layers such as, but not limited to, one or more of an abrasion resistant layer, an adhesion layer, a chemically resistant layer, a photoluminescent layer, a radiation-absorbing layer, a radiation reflective layer, a barrier layer, a planarizing layer, optical diffusing layer, and combinations thereof.\n    In still another embodiment of the present invention is method of making an organic light emitting device, as will be described further below with reference to \n    FIGS. 7-24. The method generally includes providing a substrate and disposing at least one organic device layer over the substrate, wherein the layer comprises one or more latent activator materials. The substrate is typically an electrode. The electrode substrate may also include other substrates such as but not limited to polymeric substrates.\n    The method further includes the step of generating a base or an acid by photo-activation or thermal-activation of the latent activator material. Activation may be performed at any step during the fabrication of the organic light emitting device. Activation may also be performed after the device has been assembled, at anytime during the life of the device. The method may further include the step of patterning or spatially selective activation. The patterning may be regular such as but not limited to alphabets, numerals and geometrical structures. The patterning may also be arbitrary and irregular. Spatially selective activation is achieved using a pre-machined mask, negative film, or any other means. Activation may include photo-activation of one or more latent charge-donor materials at one or more wavelengths.\n    In some embodiments the method may further include the step of spatially selective passivation, wherein spatially selective passivation comprises irradiating a latent counter activator material in contact with a activated region. For example, a p-activated layer may be selectively passivated or de-activated by irradiating a photobase-generator in contact with the p-activated layer. Patterning of the OLED can also be achieved by spatially selective passivation.\n    The method may further comprise disposing over the substrate a hole transport layer material, a hole injection layer material, an electron transport layer material, an electron injection layer material, a photoabsorption layer material, acathode layer material, an anode layer material or an electroluminescent layer material, or any combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the method may further include laminating together layers, with at least one layer including a latent activator material or activation products of a latent activator material.\n    In some embodiments, the latent activator material is deposited in combination with other OLED layer materials. For example, a latent activator material may be deposited in combination with a light emitting layer material. In other embodiments, the latent activator material is deposited on top of an OLED layer. Upon activation, the activator material released, surface modifies the underlying layer.\n    The method of depositing or disposing a layer comprises techniques such as but not limited to spin coating, dip coating, reverse roll coating, wire-wound or Mayer rod coating, direct and offset gravure coating, slot die coating, blade coating, hot melt coating, curtain coating, knife over roll coating, extrusion, air knife coating, spray, rotary screen coating, multilayer slide coating, coextrusion, meniscus coating, comma and microgravure coating, lithographic process, langmuir process and flash evaporation, vapor deposition, plasma-enhanced chemical-vapor deposition (“PECVD”), radio-frequency plasma-enhanced chemical-vapor deposition (“RFPECVD”), expanding thermal-plasma chemical-vapor deposition (“ETPCVD”), sputtering including, but not limited to, reactive sputtering, electron-cyclotron-resonance plasma-enhanced chemical-vapor deposition (ECRPECVD”), inductively coupled plasma-enhanced chemical-vapor deposition (“ICPECVD”), and like techniques, and combinations thereof.\n    \n    FIGS. 7-22are cross-sectional representations of exemplary processes of fabricating organic light emitting devices illustrated in \n    FIGS. 1-6, according to aspects of the present technique. An electrode \n    80, as illustrated in \n    FIG. 7, is used as a substrate to deposit subsequent layers. An example of an electrode is an ITO anode. In certain embodiments, the electrode may further include a polymeric substrate. The electrode may be subject to UV/ozone surface treatment prior to deposition of subsequent layers. As used herein, device sub-structures may include one or more substrate layers, one or more electrode layers, one or more latent activated layers, one or more activated layers, one or more electroactive layers, or one or more additional layers such as but not limited to adhesion layers, and barrier layers. In some embodiments, two or more device sub-structures may be deposited or disposed over each other to form the organic light emitting devices. In further embodiments, two or more device sub-structures may be combined to form an organic light emitting device using processes such as but not limited to lamination.\n    As shown in \n    FIG. 8, a latent activated electroactive layer \n    82with a latent activator material is deposited over the electrode. The latent activated electroactive layer \n    82may be an organic electroactive layer and may further include, for example, a hole transport material or a light emitting material. As shown in \n    FIG. 9, the latent activated electroactive layer \n    82including latent activator material is then activated by the application of heat or light, and thermal or photoactivation respectively, as indicated by reference numeral \n    84. The activation of the latent activated electroactive layer \n    82results in an activated electroactive layer \n    86as shown in \n    FIG. 10to form a device sub-structure \n    89. Other layers may be deposited over the sub-structure to form the light emitting device. The process may proceed further with the deposition of at least one more electroactive organic layer \n    88. Finally, as shown in \n    FIG. 11, a second electrode \n    90, such as a cathode layer, may be deposited over the electroactive layer \n    88to form a light emitting device \n    20(see \n    FIG. 2).\n    Alternatively the process may proceed from the process step shown in \n    FIG. 8to the process step shown in \n    FIG. 12, where an electroactive layer \n    88is deposited over the latent activated electroactive layer \n    82. The device \n    10(see \n    FIG. 1) is completed on disposing an electrode \n    90over the electroactive layer \n    82. The latent activated electroactive layer \n    82may be subsequently activated by the application of thermal or photoactivation \n    84resulting in the formation of an activated layer \n    86and the device \n    20, as shown in \n    FIG. 15.\n    In another alternate process path, the process may proceed from the process step shown in \n    FIG. 8to the process step shown in \n    FIG. 16, where the electroactive layer \n    82may be selectively activated. Selective activation can result in the patterning of the OLED device. Patterning can be desirably regular or arbitrary. Selective activation results in a patterned layer \n    91, with activated regions \n    92with activator material and still latent activated regions \n    94as shown in \n    FIG. 17. Additional layers such as an electroactive layer \n    88and an electrode layer \n    90may be deposited to fabricate the light emitting device \n    30as shown in \n    FIG. 18.\n    Alternatively, the process may proceed from the process step shown in \n    FIG. 12to the process step shown in \n    FIG. 19, where a second latent activated layer \n    95may be deposited over the electroactive layer \n    88. The latent activated layer \n    95is subjected to photo or thermal activation \n    94to give a second activated layer \n    96as shown in \n    FIG. 20. As shown in \n    FIG. 21a second electrode may be disposed over the second activated layer \n    96resulting in the device \n    52. In a non-limiting example, the first activated layer \n    86is a p-activated layer and the second activated layer \n    96is an n-activated layer.\n    Alternatively, the process which includes the process step shown in \n    FIG. 10, where a first device sub-structure \n    89, including an electrode \n    80, a first activated layer \n    86and an additional electroactive layer \n    88, is formed, may also include the process step shown in \n    FIG. 22, where a second device sub-structure \n    97including an activated layer \n    96and a second electrode substrate layer \n    90is formed. The activated layer \n    96may be formed by activating a latent activated layer, such as layer \n    95, shown in \n    FIG. 19. Following the process steps to make the first and second device sub-structures, \n    89and \n    97, the two sub structures may be laminated together to form a device \n    52, as shown in \n    FIG. 21. In some embodiments, lamination is carried out by bringing together the first device sub-structure and the second device sub-structure, and applying one of pressure or heat or combinations thereof to the substructures. In one embodiment, the first device sub-structure \n    89, and the second device sub-structure \n    97, are overlaid and guided through a roll laminator to form the device \n    52. In some embodiments, lamination is performed at a temperature of 150° C. In certain embodiments, activation of latent activator materials in a sub-structure may occur prior to lamination as shown in \n    FIGS. 10 and 19. In other embodiments, activation of the latent of latent activator materials in a sub-structure may occur subsequent to lamination, such that at the time of lamination, the first and/or second device structures may include latent activated layers. In a non-limiting example, first and second device substructures may include one or more substrate layers, one or more electrodes, one or more latent activated layers, one or more activated layers, one or more electroactive layers, or one or more other layers such as but not limited to adhesion layers, and barrier layers.\n    \n    FIG. 23is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary process \n    100of fabricating an organic light emitting device according to aspects of the present technique as. The process \n    100includes the step of providing a substrate \n    102(see \n    FIG. 7), which may be an electrode, for example, disposing a layer comprising a latent activator material over the substrate \n    104(see \n    FIG. 8), disposing one or more additional organic layers over the substrate \n    106(see \n    FIG. 12), and then disposing a second electrode over the substrate \n    108(see \n    FIG. 13).\n    \n    FIG. 24is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary process \n    110of fabricating a organic light emitting device according to aspects of the present technique. Process \n    110begins with step \n    112, where a substrate, which may be an electrode, for example, is provided (see \n    FIG. 7). The process \n    110proceeds with step \n    114of disposing a layer comprising a latent activator material over the substrate (see \n    FIG. 8). In step \n    116, the process proceeds to activate the activator material by photo or thermal activation (see \n    FIG. 9).\n    \n    FIG. 25is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary process \n    118of fabricating the organic light emitting device according to aspects of the present technique. In step \n    120of process \n    118a substrate, which may be an electrode, for example, is provided (see \n    FIG. 7). The process \n    118proceeds with step \n    122of disposing a layer comprising a latent activator material over the substrate (see \n    FIG. 8). In step \n    124, the process proceeds to activate the activator material by photo or thermal activation (see \n    FIG. 9), followed by the step of disposing one or more additional organic layers over the substrate \n    126(see \n    FIG. 10) and finally step \n    128, where a second electrode is disposed over the substrate (see \n    FIG. 11).\n    Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art can, using the description herein, utilize the present invention to its fullest extent.

The examples provided are merely representative of the work that contributes to the teaching of the present application. Accordingly, these examples are not intended to limit the invention, as defined in the appended claims, in any manner.\n    Kelvin probe (KP) is a vibrating capacitor technique used to measure change in the effective surface work function of conducting/semi-conducting materials by measuring contact potential differences (CPDs, which correspond to changes in effective surface work functions) in units of volts relative to a common probe. KP measurements were conducted with a digital Kelvin probe KP6500.\n    EXAMPLE 1\n    A thiophene-based conducting polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) tetramethacrylate end-capped (PEDOT-TMA) obtained from Aldrich as a 0.5 wt % dispersion in propylene carbonate, was used in this example.

Indium tin oxide (ITO, about 140 nanometer) coated glass obtained from Applied Films Corporation was used as a conductive substrate. Sample 1 was bare pre-cleaned ITO, Sample 2 consisted of ITO and a layer (about 40 nanometer) of PEDOT-TMA that was applied via spin-coating from its solution in propylene carbonate at a spin-speed of 4000 rpm, Sample 3 consisted of ITO and a layer (about 35 nanometer) of PEDOT-TMA:Ph\n    2IPF\n    6that was applied via spin-coating from the mixture solution at a spin-speed of 4000 rpm. KP measurements were then conducted on the samples prior to and post a ultra-violet ozone treatment. Both the UV-ozone treatment and the KP measurements (with a Ultraviolet Ozone Cleaner, Model 42, obtained from the Jelight Company, Irvine, Calif. 92618, U.S.A.) were conducted in the ambient environment with a room temperature of about 24° C. and a relative humidity of about 64%.\n    As can be seen from the results listed in Table 1, introducing PEDOT-TMA did not cause significant changes in CPD (and equivalently, the effective work function) of the ITO substrate, regardless of whether the PEDOT-TMA was UV-ozone treated (Activated Sample 2) or not (Sample 2). Similarly, the presence of PEDOT-TMA:Ph\n    2IPF\n    6, as spin-coated (Sample 3) did not significantly alter the measured CPD. However, a significant reduction in CPD (equivalently, increase in effective work function) was observed after the PEDOT-TMA:Ph\n    2IPF\n    6mixture layer was UV-ozone treated.\n    EXAMPLE 2\n    Six OLED devices were fabricated. The OLEDs consisted of a blue light-emitting polymer (LEP), ADS329BE [poly(9,9-dioctylfluoenyl-2,7-diyl)—end capped with N,N-Bis(4-methylphenyl)-aniline], obtained from American Dye Sources, Inc, Canada, and used as received without any further purification, as the emissive layer material.\n    The OLEDs were fabricated as follows. ITO coated glass, patterned using standard photolithography techniques, was used as the anode substrate. The OLEDs employ an ITO anode with and without an additional anode-activation layer but otherwise the same structure. As shown in the Table 2, both device A and device B had the same ITO anode except that the ITO substrate in device B was further UV-ozoned for 5 minutes prior to the application of ADS329BE. Devices C and D had the same anode-activation layer of PEDOT-TMA (about 40 to 45 nanometer) except that the PEDOT-TMA layer in the device D was further UV-ozoned for about 5 minutes prior to the application of ADS329BE. Both device E and F had the same anode-activation layer (about 35 nanometer) of PEDOT-TMA:Ph\n    2IPF\n    6except that the PEDOT-TMA:Ph\n    2IPF\n    6layer in the device F was further UV-ozoned for about 5 minutes prior to the application of ADS329BE. Next, a layer (65±3 nanometer) of ADS329BE was spin-coated from its solution (1.7 wt %) in p-xylene atop of the ITO with and without the anode-activation layers. Application of the anode-activation layers and the ADS329BE layer as well as UV-ozone treatments were all conducted in the ambient environment with a room temperature of 24° C. and a relative humidity of 64%. Then the samples were transferred into a glovebox filled with Argon (moisture and oxygen was less than about 1 ppm and about 10 ppm, respectively). Next, a NaF(4 nanometer)/Al (110 nanometer) bilayer cathode was then thermally-evaporated atop of the ADS329 emissive layer. After metallization (metallization refers to disposing metal layers such as aluminum to electrically connect or interconnect various device structures), the devices were encapsulated with a cover glass sealed with an optical adhesive Norland 68 obtained from Norland products, Inc, Cranbury, N.J. 08512, USA.

It can be seen that the use of UV-ozone treated PEDOT-TMA:Ph\n    2IPF\n    6anode-activation layer yielded an OLED device with significantly enhanced efficiency and much-lowered turn-on voltage (defined as the applied voltage when the corresponding brightness has reached 1 cd/m2) relative to the devices having either a bare ITO anode or with the PEDOT-TMA anode-activation layer. Since all devices share the same type of emissive layer as well as the same type of bilayer cathode, the enhancement in performance can be attributed to the fact that the ITO electrode had been activated by the PEDOT-TMA: Ph\n    2IPF\n    6, leading to much enhanced hole-injection. The measured performance characteristics indicate that the presence of Ph\n    2IPF\n    6and the UV-ozone treatment are the key factors contributing to the observed activation effect.\n    Although the applicants do not wish to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that upon UV irradiation (and/or other latent means), Ph\n    2IPF\n    6, widely known as a photoacid generator, decomposes and generates a strong acid (HPF\n    6) and the (photo)-generated acid is able to activate the PEDOT-TMA host and most likely the PEDOT-TMA:Ph\n    2IPF\n    6/LEP interface as well, thus resulting in much enhanced hole-injection from the ITO electrode into the active LEP layer and, subsequently, the overall performance\n    EXAMPLE 3\n    A 2 liter, 3-neck flask was charged with Adogen 464 (about 23 grams), 2-bromo-propane (about 235 milliliter), potassium hydroxide (saturated, aq, about 1.2 liter), and freshly cracked and distilled cyclopentadiene (41 milliliter). The contents were stirred with a mechanical stirrer and heated to about 80° C. for 24 hours. Gas chromatography analysis of the top layer showed excellent conversion to tetra-isopropylcyclopentadiene. The entire reaction mixture was poured into a separatory funnel. Addition of water and hexanes broke up the emulsion and the top layer was collected. The bottom aqueous layer was washed with hexanes, and a total of about 1.5 liter of organic solvents was collected. The organic layer was then dried with magnesium sulfate and then filtered and washed with more hexanes. The total organics were then subjected to rotary evaporation (30 mmHg) and 80° C. to remove hexanes and leave a higher boiling oil. The oil was then subjected to vacuum distillation through a Vigreaux column, 0.6 mmHg. Fractions that boiled between 110-130° C. were collected (about 53.1 grams). The entire distillate was dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) (about 500 milliliter) and then potassium (about 10 grams) was slowly added and gas evolution was noted. The contents were stirred for 17 hours. The reaction was quenched by addition of water. The contents were extracted with hexanes, dried with magnesium sulfate and then the hexanes were removed in vacuo. The recovered oil was placed in the refrigerator to give colorless crystals, C\n    5H\n    2(i-propyl)\n    4.\n    C\n    5H\n    2(i-propyl)\n    4, as prepared above (about 8.12 grams) was combined with THF (about 100 milliliter) and potassium hydride (about 1.4 grams) and stirred for about 24 hours. The solution was filtered under nitrogen and washed with dry THF under nitrogen to give a white solid, tetra-i-propyl-cyclopentadienyl potassium (K[HC\n    5(i-propyl)\n    4]). K[HC\n    5(i-propyl)\n    4] (about 2.81 gram) was combined with barium iodide (about 2 gram) in THF (50 milliliter) and stirred for about 24 hours under nitrogen. The solution was filtered under nitrogen to remove potassium iodide and the solid was washed with THF. The THF was removed in vacuo to give a solid that contained Bis(tetra-i-propyl-cyclopentadienyl) barium (Ba-TPCP).\n    About 55.7 milligram Ba-TPCP was dissolved in about 11 milliliter of xylenes to prepare a solution with a nominal concentration of about 0.5 wt %. The solution was prepared in the glovebox filled with argon (moisture and oxygen was less than about 1 parts per million (ppm) and about 3 ppm, respectively). The solution, as prepared, had some undissolved material(s) precipitated on the bottom of the glass vial. The top clear solution was taken and used without any filtration steps.\n    Three samples, Sample 4, Sample 5 and Sample 6 were prepared for KP measurements. For all samples, a layer (about 80 nm) of Al, used as a conductive substrate, was initially thermally evaporated over a pre-cleaned glass slide.\n    KP measurements on Sample 4 were conducted on the Al substrate prior to and post exposure to the ambient environment (referred to as “air exposure”) and baking. The ambient environment refers to normal room conditions with a temperature of about 24° C. and relative humidity of about 62% when the experiments were conducted. For Sample 5, the solution of Ba-TPCP was spin-coated on top of the Al in the same glovebox. A series of KP measurements were then conducted on Sample 5, (1) as spin-coated, (2) after a step air exposure for 3 mins, (3) after a step of baking at about 180° C. for about 15 minutes in the glovebox, (4) after another air exposure for 3 minutes, (5) after another step of baking at about 180° C. for about 15 minutes in the same glovebox and (6) after another air exposure for about 3 minutes. For Sample 6, the solution of Ba-TPCP was spin-coated over the Al in the glovebox. A series of KP measurements were then conducted on Sample 6 (1) as spin-coated, (2) after a step of baking at about 180° C. for about 15 minutes in the same glovebox, (3) after air exposure for about 3 minutes.\n    Results of KP measurements are summarized in Table 3. Measurements indicate that the baking step in the glovebox is critical. The increase in CPD in response to the baking step (or the 1\n    stbaking step as for the sample A) corresponds to a significant reduction in effective work function.\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n              \n                TABLE 3\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n              \n              \n                Experimental results of Kelvin probe (KP) measurements\n              \n              \n                of contact potential difference (CPD) on Al\n              \n              \n                with and without the Ba-TPCP layer\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                CPD\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                \n                average of 20\n                standard\n              \n              \n                \n                Treatment\n                data points\n                deviation\n              \n              \n                \n                \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                SAMPLE 4\n                As prepared\n                1.372\n                0.006\n              \n              \n                Al substrate\n              \n              \n                \n                Air exposure (3 minutes)\n                1.369\n                0.006\n              \n              \n                \n                Baked at 180° C. for 15\n                1.371\n                0.007\n              \n              \n                \n                minutes\n              \n              \n                SAMPLE 5\n                As spin-coated\n                1.357\n                0.007\n              \n              \n                Al/Ba-TPCP\n              \n              \n                \n                Air exposure (3 minutes)\n                1.175\n                0.005\n              \n              \n                \n                Baked at 180° C. for 15\n                1.456\n                0.007\n              \n              \n                \n                minutes in the glovebox\n              \n              \n                \n                Air exposure (3 minutes)\n                1.055\n                0.007\n              \n              \n                \n                Baked at 180° C. for 15\n                1.123\n                0.005\n              \n              \n                \n                minutes in the glovebox\n              \n              \n                \n                Air exposure (3 minutes)\n                1.078\n                0.007\n              \n              \n                SAMPLE 6\n                as spin-coated\n                1.351\n                0.006\n              \n              \n                Al/Ba-TPCP\n              \n              \n                \n                Baked at 180° C. for 15\n                1.545\n                0.007\n              \n              \n                \n                minutes in the glovebox\n              \n              \n                \n                Air exposure (3 minutes)\n                1.013\n                0.007\n              \n              \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    EXAMPLE 4\n    Four OLED devices were fabricated. Two solutions were prepared in the same glovebox (moisture and oxygen was less than 1 ppm and 3 ppm, respectively) prior to device fabrication. The first solution (referred to OAP9903:SR454) included a green light-emitting polymer poly[(9,9-dioctylfluoren-2,7-diyl)-alt-co-(benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazol-4,7-diyl)] (OPA9903) obtained from H. W. Sands, Corporation, Jupiter, Fla. 33477, USA and an acrylate-based adhesive ethoxylated (3) trimethylolpropane triacrylate (SR454) obtained from Sartomer, Exton, Pa. 19341, USA. Both materials were used as received without any further purification. The mixture solution was prepared by mixing about 2.5 milliliter of a 2% OPA9903 solution in p-xylene with about 2 milliliter of a 1% SR454 solution in p-xylene. The resulting ratio of SR454 to OPA9903 was about 30 wt %. The second solution (referred to as OPA9903:Ba-TPCP) including OPA9903 and Ba-TPCP was prepared by mixing about 1.5 milliliter of a 0.6 wt % OPA9903 solution in xylenes with about 3 milliliter of the Ba-TPCP solution in xylenes.\n    OLEDs were fabricated as follows. Pre-patterned ITO coated glass used as the anode substrate was cleaned with UV-ozone for 10 mins. Then a layer (60 nm) of [poly(3,4)-ethylendioxythiophene/polystyrene sulfonate] (PEDOT/PSS) polymer obtained from Bayer Corporation was deposited atop the ITO via spin-coating and then baked for 1 hour at 180° C. in the ambient environment (with a room temperature of 24° C. and a relative humidity of 62%). Then the samples were transferred to the same glovebox. The following steps, unless further specified, were carried out in the same glovebox. Next, the emissive layer consisting of OPA9903:SR454 was spin-coated from its solution in p-xylene atop the PEDOT/PSS layer and then cured with a UV lamp (R-52 grid lamp, obtained from Ultroviolet Products, Upland, Calif., 91796, U.S.A. with the filter removed) (the intensity measured at about 310 nm, 365 nm and 400 nm was 0.39, 0.43 and 1.93 mW/cm\n    2) for 1 minute. Next, a layer of the mixture of OPA9903:Ba-TPCP was spin-coated atop the cured emissive layer and then baked at about 180° C. for about 15 minutes. Finally, a layer (about 110 nanometer) of Al was then thermally evaporated through a shadow mask atop of the OPA9903:Ba-TPCP layer. Following metal evaporation, the devices were encapsulated using a glass slide sealed with the optical adhesive Norland 68. The active area is about 0.2 cm\n    2.\n    Four OLED devices were made. Control device, device G, did not have the mixture layer of OPA9903:Ba-TPCP. Devices H, I and J had the same structure except that the mixture layer of OPA9903:Ba-TPCP was treated differently prior to the Al deposition. For device H, the mixture layer, as spin-coated, was exposed to the ambient environment for about 3 minutes, then baked at 180° C. for about 15 minutes in the same glovebox. For device I, the mixture layer was not exposed to the ambient environment, and for the device J, the mixture layer was exposed to the ambient environment for 3 minutes after the baking step. \n    FIG. 25shows the efficiency (measured in candela per ampere, cd/A) versus current density (measured in milliamperes per square centimeter, mA/cm\n    2) for devices G, H, J, and I.\n    Comparison of the efficiency \n    130versus current density \n    132curves indicates that introducing the mixture layer of OPA9903:Ba-TPCP as in the device H (curve \n    136), I (curve \n    140) and J (curve \n    138) significantly improves the device efficiency relative to the control device G (curve \n    134). Since all four devices share the same anode, it is believed that the observed improvement in efficiency directly reflects the activation of the bare Al cathode. Furthermore, the plots also indicate that the sequence of baking and exposure to ambient environment is important. The device I without any exposure to ambient the environment showed the greatest improvement relative to the device H and the device J. The device H that was exposed to the ambient environment prior to the baking step shows better efficiency relative to the device J that was exposed to the ambient environment post the baking step.\n    Although the Applicants do not wish to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that upon baking (and/or other latent means) the barium compound (Ba-TPCP) decomposes and releases free barium atoms that are able to, subsequently, activate the active polymer (OPA9903). Equation 5, shows an alkaline earth metal organometallic compound M-TPCP, where M is any alkaline earth metal including barium, decomposing on application of heat to release the free metal atoms.\n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    The activated OPA9903 facilitates the electron injection from the bare Al cathode into the active layer of OPA9903.\n    The previously described embodiments of the present invention have many advantages, including, providing OLED devices with greater conductivity leading to possible increases in OLED light emitting efficiencies.\n    While only certain features of the invention have been illustrated and described herein, many modifications and changes will occur to those skilled in the art. It is, therefore, to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the invention.","lang":"en"}],"ipc_classifications":[{"text":"C07F300"}],"pub_numbers":[{"doc_number":"US20100230829"},{"doc_number":"20100230829"},{"doc_number":"US20100230829A1"}],"abstract":"An organic light emitting device with a latent activator material is presented.
