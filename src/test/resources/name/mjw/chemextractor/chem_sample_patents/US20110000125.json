Generally, the nomenclature used herein and the laboratory procedures of cell culture, molecular genetics, organic chemistry, analytical chemistry and nucleic acid chemistry described below are those well known and commonly employed in the art.\n    As used herein, the following terms are intended to have the following meanings: The following abbreviations are used herein: “FAR” denotes fatty acyl reductase or fatty alcohol forming acyl-CoA reductase; “ACP” denotes acyl carrier protein; “CoA” denotes coenzyme A; “TE” denotes thioesterase; “FAS” denotes fatty acid synthase; “FACR” denotes fatty acyl-CoA reductase; “FACS” denotes fatty acyl-CoA synthase (synthetase) and acyl-CoA synthase (synthetase) as used interchangeably herein; and “ACC” denotes acetyl-CoA carboxylase.\n    “Fatty alcohol forming acyl-CoA reductase” or “fatty acyl reductase” as used interchangeably herein refers to an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of a fatty acyl-CoA, a fatty acyl-ACP, or other fatty acyl thioester complex to a fatty alcohol, which is linked to the oxidation of NAD(P)H to NAD(P)\n    +, as shown in Scheme I:\n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    wherein “R” represents a C8 to C24 saturated, unsaturated, linear, branched or cyclic hydrocarbon, and “R\n    1” represents CoA, ACP or other fatty acyl thioester substrates. CoA is a non-protein acyl carrier group factor (or moiety) involved in the synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids. “ACP” is a polypeptide or protein subunit of fatty acid synthase used in the synthesis of fatty acids. FARs are distinct from FACRs. FACRs reduce only fatty acyl-CoA intermediates to fatty aldehydes and require an additional oxidoreductase enzyme to generate the corresponding fatty alcohol. “Fatty aldehyde” as used herein refers to a saturated or unsaturated aliphatic aldehyde and reference is made to \n    FIG. 13, wherein R is as defined above.\n    The term “fatty acid” as used herein refers to a compound of formula III:\n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    wherein “R” is as defined above. Saturated or unsaturated fatty acids can be described as “Ca:b”, wherein “a” is an integer that represents the total number of carbon atoms and “b” is an integer that refers to the number of double bonds in the carbon chain.\n    The term “fatty alcohol” as used herein refers to an aliphatic alcohol of the formula (II) wherein R is as defined above. Saturated or unsaturated fatty alcohols can be described as “Ca:b-OH”, wherein “a” is an integer that represents the total number of carbon atoms in the fatty alcohol and “b” is an integer that refers to the number of double bonds in carbon chain.\n    Unsaturated fatty acids or fatty alcohols can be referred to as “cis Δ\n    x” or “trans Δ\n    x” wherein “cis” and “trans” refer to the carbon chain configuration around the double bond and “x” indicates the number of the first carbon of the double bond, wherein carbon 1 is the carboxylic acid carbon of the fatty acid or the carbon bound to the —OH group of the fatty alcohol.\n    The term “fatty acyl-thioester” or “fatty acyl-thioester complex” refers to a compound of formula (I), wherein a fatty acyl moiety is covalently linked via a thioester linkage to a carrier moiety. Fatty acyl-thioesters are substrates for the FAR enzymes described herein.\n    The term “fatty acyl-CoA” refers to a compound of formula (I) wherein R\n    1is Coenzyme A.\n    The term “fatty acyl-ACP” refers to a compound of formula (I) wherein R\n    1is acyl carrier protein.\n    The phrase “acyl-CoA independent pathway” refers to the production of fatty alcohols by the direct enzymatic conversion of fatty acyl-ACP substrates to fatty alcohols and does not involve the use of free fatty acids or fatty acyl-CoA intermediates. This biosynthetic pathway differs from a) the fatty acyl-CoA dependent pathway which converts fatty acyl-ACP directly to fatty acyl CoA via an acyl-transfer reaction, such as in yeast, and b) the fatty acyl-CoA dependent pathway which converts fatty acyl-ACP to fatty acyl-CoA via a free fatty acid intermediate, such as in bacteria and reference is made to \n    FIG. 13.\n    The acyl-CoA independent pathway has the advantage of bypassing the step of form a fatty acyl-CoA substrate from free fatty acid, which requires the use of ATP. Therefore, the acyl-CoA independent pathway may use less energy than the acyl-CoA dependent pathway that utilizes a free fatty acid intermediate.\n    “Conversion” refers to the enzymatic conversion of the substrate to the corresponding product. “Percent conversion” refers to the percent of the substrate that is reduced to the product within a period of time under specified conditions. Thus, the “enzymatic activity” or “activity” of a polypeptide can be expressed as “percent conversion” of the substrate to the product.\n    “Percentage of sequence identity,” “percent identity” and “percentage homology” are used interchangeably herein to refer to comparisons among polynucleotides and polypeptides, and are determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) as compared to the reference sequence (which may also contain gaps to optimize the alignment) for alignment of the two sequences. The percentage may be calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison (including positions where one of the sequences has a gap) and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. Alternatively, the percentage may be calculated by determining the number of positions at which either the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences or a nucleic acid base or amino acid residue is aligned with a gap to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. Those of skill in the art appreciate that there are many established algorithms available to align two sequences and that different methods may give slightly different results.\n    Alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, e.g., by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, 1981, Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482, by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443, by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman, 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444, by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the GCG Wisconsin Software Package), or by visual inspection (see generally, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, F. M. Ausubel et al., eds., Current Protocols, a joint venture between Greene Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., (1995 Supplement) (Ausubel)). The Clustral (Chema R., Sugawara H., Koike T., Lopez R., Gibson T. J., Higgins D. G., Thompson J. D., (2003) Multiple sequence alignment with the Clustral series of programs, Nucleic Acids Res., 31, 3497-3500.) and T-Coffee (T-COFFEE: A novel method for multiple sequence alignments. Notredame, Higgins, Heringa, J M B 302 (205-217) 2000 software packages may also be used to align sequences.\n    Examples of algorithms that are suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in Altschul et al., 1990, J. Mol. Biol. 215: 403-410 and Altschul et al., 1977, Nucleic Acids Res. 3389-3402, respectively. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information website. This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as, the neighborhood word score threshold (Altschul et al, supra). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are then extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always >0) and N (penalty score for mismatching residues; always <0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when: the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, an expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=−4, and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 3, an expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff and Henikoff, 1989, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 89:10915). Exemplary determination of sequence alignment and % sequence identity can employ the BESTFIT or GAP programs in the GCG Wisconsin Software package (Accelrys, Madison Wis.), using default parameters provided.\n    “Reference sequence” refers to a defined sequence used as a basis for a sequence comparison. A reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence, for example, a segment of a full-length gene or polypeptide sequence. Generally, a reference sequence is at least 20 nucleotide or amino acid residues in length, at least 25 residues in length, at least 50 residues in length, or the full length of the nucleic acid or polypeptide. Since two polynucleotides or polypeptides may each (1) comprise a sequence (i.e., a portion of the complete sequence) that is similar between the two sequences, and (2) may further comprise a sequence that is divergent between the two sequences, sequence comparisons between two (or more) polynucleotides or polypeptide are typically performed by comparing sequences of the two polynucleotides over a “comparison window” to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity.\n    “Comparison window” refers to a conceptual segment of at least about 20 contiguous nucleotide positions or amino acids residues wherein a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of at least 20 contiguous nucleotides or amino acids and wherein the portion of the sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) of 20 percent or less as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The comparison window can be longer than 20 contiguous residues, and includes, optionally 30, 40, 50, 100, or longer windows.\n    “Conservative” amino acid substitutions or mutations refer to the interchangeability of residues having similar side chains, and thus typically involves substitution of the amino acid in the polypeptide with amino acids within the same or similar defined class of amino acids. However, as used herein, conservative mutations do not include substitutions from a hydrophilic to hydrophilic, hydrophobic to hydrophobic, hydroxyl-containing to hydroxyl-containing, or small to small residue, if the conservative mutation can instead be a substitution from an aliphatic to an aliphatic, non-polar to non-polar, polar to polar, acidic to acidic, basic to basic, aromatic to aromatic, or constrained to constrained residue. Further, as used herein, A, V, L, or I can be conservatively mutated to either another aliphatic residue or to another non-polar residue.

Non-conservative substitutions may use amino acids between, rather than within, the defined groups listed above. In one embodiment, a non-conservative mutation affects (a) the structure of the peptide backbone in the area of the substitution (e.g., proline for glycine) (b) the charge or hydrophobicity, or (c) the bulk of the side chain.\n    “Deletion” refers to modification to the polypeptide by removal of one or more amino acids from the reference polypeptide. Deletions can comprise removal of 1 or more amino acids, 2 or more amino acids, 5 or more amino acids, 10 or more amino acids, 15 or more amino acids, or 20 or more amino acids, up to 10% of the total number of amino acids, or up to 20% of the total number of amino acids making up the reference enzyme while retaining enzymatic activity and/or retaining the improved properties of an engineered enzyme. Deletions can be directed to the internal portions and/or terminal portions of the polypeptide. In various embodiments, the deletion can comprise a continuous segment or can be discontinuous. The term “deletion” is also used to refer to a DNA modification in which one or more nucleotides or nucleotide base-pairs have been removed, as compared to the corresponding reference, parental or “wild type” DNA.\n    “Insertion” refers to modification to the polypeptide by addition of one or more amino acids to the reference polypeptide. In some embodiments, the modification comprises insertions of one or more amino acids to the naturally occurring polypeptide as well as insertions of one or more amino acids to other modified polypeptides. Insertions can be in the internal portions of the polypeptide, or to the carboxy or amino terminus. Insertions as used herein include fusion proteins as is known in the art. The insertion can be a contiguous segment of amino acids or separated by one or more of the amino acids in the naturally occurring polypeptide. The term “insertion” is also used to refer to a DNA modification in which or more nucleotides or nucleotide base-pairs have been inserted, as compared to the corresponding reference, parental or “wild type” DNA.\n    “Different from” or “differs from” with respect to a designated reference sequence refers to difference of a given amino acid or polynucleotide sequence when aligned to the reference sequence. Generally, the differences can be determined when the two sequences are optimally aligned. Differences include insertions, deletions, or substitutions of amino acid residues in comparison to the reference sequence.\n    As used herein in the context of a polypeptide or polynucleotide, the phrase “derived from” a particular organism refers to a wild-type polynucleotide or polypeptide that originates in the organism and to mutant and variants thereof that either originate in the organism or are produced by human manipulation of the wild-type polynucleotide or polypeptide.\n    “Functional fragment” as used herein refers to a polypeptide that has an amino-terminal and/or carboxy-terminal deletion, but where the remaining amino acid sequence is identical to the corresponding positions in the sequence and that retains substantially all of the activity of the full-length polypeptide. Functional fragments can comprise up to 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, and 99% of the full-length polypeptide.\n    “Endogenous” polynucleotide, gene, promoter or polypeptide refers to any polynucleotide, gene, promoter or polypeptide that originates in a particular host cell. A polynucleotide, gene, promoter or polypeptide is not endogenous to a host cell if it has been removed from the host cell, subjected to laboratory manipulation, and then reintroduced into a host cell.\n    “Heterologous” polynucleotide, gene, promoter or polypeptide refers to any polynucleotide, gene, promoter or polypeptide that is introduced into a host cell that is not normally present in that cell, and includes any polynucleotide, gene, promoter or polypeptide that is removed from the host cell and then reintroduced into the host cell.\n    “Inactive” or “inactivated” in reference to a gene refers to a gene having at least one function that is impaired. Genes can be inactivated in a variety of ways known in the art, including but not limited to insertion of a mobile genetic element (e.g., a transposon); deletion of all or part of the gene, such that the gene product is not made, or is truncated and is non-functional; mutation of the gene such that the gene product is not made, or is truncated and is non-functional; deletion or mutation of one or more control elements that control expression of the gene such that the gene product is not made; and the like. In certain embodiments genes can be inactivated by methods other than genetic modification, for example, by gene silencing at the transcriptional level or at the post-transcriptional level using for example RNAi.\n    “Recombinant host cell” refers to a cell into which has been introduced a heterologous polynucleotide, gene, promoter, e.g., an expression vector, or to a cell having a heterologous polynucleotide or gene integrated into the genome.\n    “Naturally-occurring” or “wild-type” refers to the form found in nature. For example, a naturally occurring or wild-type polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence is a sequence present in an organism that can be isolated from a source in nature and which has not been intentionally modified by human manipulation. A wild-type organism refers to an organism that has not been intentionally modified by human manipulation.\n    “Codon optimized” refers to changes in the codons of the polynucleotide encoding a protein to those preferentially used in a particular organism such that the encoded protein is efficiently expressed in the organism of interest. Although the genetic code is degenerate in that most amino acids are represented by several codons, called “synonyms” or “synonymous” codons, it is well known that codon usage by particular organisms is nonrandom and biased towards particular codon triplets. This codon usage bias may be higher in reference to a given gene, genes of common function or ancestral origin, highly expressed proteins versus low copy number proteins, and the aggregate protein coding regions of an organism's genome. In some embodiments, the polynucleotides encoding enzymes may be codon optimized for optimal production from the host organism selected for expression.\n    “Preferred, optimal, high codon usage bias codons” refers interchangeably to codons that are used at higher frequency in the protein coding regions than other codons that code for the same amino acid. The preferred codons may be determined in relation to codon usage in a single gene, a set of genes of common function or origin, highly expressed genes, the codon frequency in the aggregate protein coding regions of the whole organism, codon frequency in the aggregate protein coding regions of related organisms, or combinations thereof. Codons whose frequency increases with the level of gene expression are typically optimal codons for expression. A variety of methods are known for determining the codon frequency (e.g., codon usage, relative synonymous codon usage) and codon preference in specific organisms, including multivariate analysis, for example, using cluster analysis or correspondence analysis, and the effective number of codons used in a gene (See GCG Codon Preference, Genetics Computer Group Wisconsin Package; CodonW, John Peden, University of Nottingham; McInerney, J. O, \n    1998, Bioinformatics 14:372-73; Stenico et al., 1994, Nucleic Acids Res. 222437-46; Wright, F., 1990, Gene 87:23-29). Codon usage tables are available for a growing list of organisms (see for example, Wada et al., 1992, Nucleic Acids Res. 20:2111-2118; Nakamura et al., 2000, Nucl. Acids Res. 28:292; Duret, et al., supra; Henaut and Danchin, “\n    Escherichia coliand \n    Salmonella,”1996, Neidhardt, et al. Eds., ASM Press, Washington D.C., p. 2047-2066), all of which are incorporated herein by reference. The data source for obtaining codon usage may rely on any available nucleotide sequence capable of coding for a protein. These data sets include nucleic acid sequences actually known to encode expressed proteins (e.g., complete protein coding sequences-CDS), expressed sequence tags (ESTs), or predicted coding regions of genomic sequences (see for example, Mount, D., Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis, Chapter 8, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 2001; Uberbacher, E. C., 1996, Methods Enzymol. 266:259-281; Tiwari et al., 1997, Comput. Appl. Biosci. 13:263-270), all of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n    “Expression” as used herein may include any step involved in the production of the FAR polypeptides including but not limited to transcription and translation.\n    “Control sequence” is defined herein to include all components, which are necessary or advantageous for the expression of a polypeptide of the present disclosure. Each control sequence may be native or foreign to the nucleic acid sequence encoding the polypeptide. Such control sequences include, but are not limited to, a leader, polyadenylation sequence, propeptide sequence, promoter, signal peptide sequence, and transcription terminator. At a minimum, the control sequences include a promoter, and transcriptional and translational stop signals. The control sequences may be provided with linkers for the purpose of introducing specific restriction sites facilitating ligation of the control sequences with the coding region of the nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide.\n    “Operably linked” and “operably associated” are defined herein as a configuration in which a control sequence is appropriately placed at a position relative to the coding sequence of the DNA sequence such that the control sequence directs the expression of a polynucleotide and/or polypeptide.\n    “Promoter sequence” is a nucleic acid sequence that is recognized by a host cell for expression of the coding region. The control sequence may comprise an appropriate promoter sequence. The promoter sequence contains transcriptional control sequences, which mediate the expression of the polypeptide. The promoter may be any nucleic acid sequence which shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice including mutant, truncated, and hybrid promoters, and may be obtained from genes encoding extracellular or intracellular polypeptides either endogenous or heterologous to the host cell.\n    As used herein the term “transformed” or “transformation” used in reference to a cell means a cell has a non-native nucleic acid sequence integrated into its genome or as a plasmid that is maintained through multiple generations.\n    It should be noted that the indefinite articles “a” and “an” and the definite article “the” are used in the present application to mean one or more unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Further, the term “or” is used in the present application to mean the disjunctive “or” and the conjunctive “and”.\n    FAR Enzymes Useful in the Methods of the Disclosure:\n    In one aspect the present disclosure provides FAR enzymes derived from or obtained from gammaproteobacteria (such as marine gammaproteobacteria) and/or functional fragments thereof having FAR activity.

See Aarts M G et al. (1997) \n    Plant J.12:615-623. This family of binding domains is designated “NAD_binding\n    —4” (PF07993; see http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/family?acc=PF07993). In various embodiments, the NAD_binding\n    —4 domain is found near the N-terminus of the putative FAR enzyme. In various embodiments, the one or more protein domains by which enzymes with FAR activity are identified belongs to a family of domains known as a “sterile” domain (PF03015; see http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/family?acc=PF03015), which are also found in the male sterility proteins of \n    Arabidopsisspecies and a number of other organisms. See Aarts M G et al. (1997) \n    Plant J.12:615-623. In particular embodiments, the sterile domain is found near the C-terminus of the putative FAR enzyme. In certain specific embodiments, a FAR enzyme for use in the methods described herein is identified by the presence of at least one NAD_binding\n    —4 domain near the N-terminus and the presence of at least one sterile domain near the C-terminus.\n    In certain embodiments, the NAD_binding\n    —4 domain of the putative FAR enzyme has an amino acid sequence that is at least 10%, such as at least 15%, such as at least 20%, such as at least 25%, such as at least 30%, such as at least 35%, such as at least 40%, such as at least 45%, such as at least 50%, such as at least 60%, such as at least 70%, such as at least 80%, such as at least 85%, such as at least 90% or more identical to the amino acid sequence of a known NAD_binding\n    —4 domain. See, e.g., Aarts M G et al. (1997) \n    Plant J.12:615-623. In various embodiments, the sterile domain of the putative FAR enzyme has an amino acid sequence that is at least 10%, such as at least 15%, such as at least 20%, such as at least 25%, such as at least 30%, such as at least 35%, such as at least 40%, such as at least 45%, such as at least 50% or more identical to the amino acid sequence of a known sterile domain.

In certain embodiments, the sterile domain of the putative FAR enzyme has an amino acid sequence that is at least 10%, such as at least 15%, such as at least 20%, such as at least 25%, such as at least 30%, such as at least 35%, such as at least 40%, such as at least 45%, such as at least 50% or more identical to the amino acid sequence of one or more example polypeptides that form the definition of the sterile Pfam domain (PF03015). In various embodiments, the NAD_binding\n    —4 domain or the sterile domain of the putative FAR enzyme is identified by an E-value of 1×10\n    −4or less, such as an E-value of 1×10\n    −5, such as an E-value of 1×10\n    −10, such as an E-value of 1×10\n    −15, such as an E-value of 1×10\n    −20, such as an E-value of 1×10\n    −25, such as an E-value of 1×10\n    −30or lower. As used herein, the term E-value (expectation value) is the number of hits that would be expected to have a score equal or better than a particular hit by chance alone. Accordingly, the E-value is a criterion by which the significance of a database search hit can be evaluated.

The polynucleotide can be a DNA or RNA, and can be single-stranded or double-stranded. The polynucleotide can be isolated from a naturally occurring microorganism, or prepared wholly or partially via synthetic means. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide is a construct designed to provide for expression of the encoded FAR enzyme or functional fragment in a host microorganism. The FAR enzyme or the specific or functional fragment encoded by the polynucleotide construct may be endogenous or heterologous to the host microorganism.\n    In various aspects of the disclosure, the availability of a polypeptide sequence of a specific FAR enzyme provides a description of all polynucleotides capable of encoding the polypeptide of known sequence because of the known correspondence of particular codons and the amino acids they encode. In certain embodiments, the degeneracy of the genetic code is used to produce a large number of polynucleotides that encode the gamma proteobacterial FAR polypeptides described herein. Thus, for example, the codons AGA, AGG, CGA, CGC, CGG, and CGU all encode the amino acid arginine (R). Thus, at every position in the nucleic acids of the invention where an arginine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described above without altering the encoded polypeptide. In some embodiments, the polynucleotides that encode the FAR enzymes described herein are codon optimized for expression in a recombinant host cells. In particular embodiments, the polynucleotides that encode the FAR enzymes described herein are codon optimized for expression in bacteria, yeast or filamentous fungi. In various embodiments, the polynucleotides that encode the FAR enzymes described herein are codon optimized for expression in oleaginous yeast.

Nucleic acids “hybridize” when they associate, typically in solution. Nucleic acids hybridize due to a variety of well-characterized physico-chemical forces, such as hydrogen bonding, solvent exclusion, base stacking and the like. As used herein, the term “stringent hybridization wash conditions” in the context of nucleic acid hybridization experiments, such as Southern and Northern hybridizations, are sequence dependent, and are different under different environmental parameters. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen, 1993, “Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology-Hybridization with Nucleic Acid Probes,” Part I, Chapter 2 (Elsevier, New York), which is incorporated herein by reference. For polynucleotides of at least 100 nucleotides in length, low to very high stringency conditions are defined as follows: prehybridization and hybridization at 42° C. in 5×SSPE, 0.3% SDS, 200 μg/ml sheared and denatured salmon sperm DNA, and either 25% formamide for low stringencies, 35% formamide for medium and medium-high stringencies, or 50% formamide for high and very high stringencies, following standard Southern blotting procedures. For polynucleotides of at least 100 nucleotides in length, the carrier material is finally washed three times each for 15 minutes using 2×SSC, 0.2% SDS at least at 50° C. (low stringency), at least at 55° C. (medium stringency), at least at 60° C. (medium-high stringency), at least at 65° C. (high stringency), and at least at 70° C. (very high stringency).\n    The polynucleotides encoding FAR enzymes for expression in heterologous recombinant host cells as described herein are operably linked to a promoter, and optionally, to other control sequences. Suitable promoters include constitutive promoters, regulated promoters, and inducible promoters. Appropriate promoter sequences can be obtained from genes encoding extracellular or intracellular polypeptides which are either endogenous or heterologous to the host cell. Methods for the isolation, identification and manipulation of promoters of varying strengths are available in or readily adapted from the art. See e.g., Nevoigt et al. (2006) \n    Appl. Environ. Microbiol.72:5266-5273, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n    In certain embodiments, the DNA constructs, vectors and polynucleotides are suitable for expression of a heterologous FAR enzyme in bacteria. For bacterial host cells, suitable promoters for directing transcription of the nucleic acid constructs of the present disclosure, include the promoters obtained from the \n    E. colilac operon, \n    Streptomyces coelicoloragarase gene (dagA), \n    Bacillus subtilislevansucrase gene (sacB), \n    Bacillus licheniformisalpha-amylase gene (amyL), \n    Bacillus stearothermophilusmaltogenic amylase gene (amyM), \n    Bacillus amyloliquefaciensalpha-amylase gene (amyQ), \n    Bacillus licheniformis penicillinasegene (penP), \n    Bacillus subtilisxylA and xylB genes, \n    Bacillus megateriumpromoters, and prokaryotic beta-lactamase gene (Villa-Kamaroff et al., \n    Proc.

Additional promoters include trp promoter, phage lambda PL, T7 promoter, promoters found at PromEC (http://margalit.huji.ac.il/promec/index.html) and the like. Promoters suitable for use in the present disclosure are described in “Useful proteins from recombinant bacteria” in \n    Scientific American242:74-94 (1980); and in Sambrook et al (2001) \n    Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,3\n    rded., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York.\n    In various embodiments, the DNA constructs, vectors and polynucleotides are suitable for expression of a heterologous FAR enzyme in yeast.

In some embodiments, the FAR enzyme is endogenous to the microorganism. In other embodiments, the FAR enzyme is heterologous to the microorganism.\n    In certain embodiments, the recombinant microorganism over expresses a gene that encodes one or more proteins other than a FAR enzyme. In various embodiments, the one or more over expressed protein increases the rate at which the recombinant cell produces the acyl-thioester FAR substrate, e.g., the compound of formula (I) shown above. In some embodiments, the one or more over expressed genes encodes a protein directly involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. In particular embodiments, the one or more over expressed genes encode a protein selected from a fatty acid synthase (FAS), an acyl-ACP thioesterase (TE), a fatty acyl-CoA synthase (FACS) and an acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). In some embodiments, the over expressed gene is endogenous to the microorganism. In other embodiments, the over expressed gene is heterologous to the microorganism.\n    “Fatty acid synthase (FAS)” refers to an enzyme or enzyme complex that catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA units to fatty acyl-ACP as set forth in Scheme II, and reference is also made to \n    FIG. 13:\n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    wherein R has the same meaning as set forth above in the definitions. In certain embodiments, the FAS is composed of more than one distinct enzymatic activity. In various embodiments, the distinct enzymatic activities reside in separate polypeptides. In some embodiments, the separate polypeptides form one or more protein complexes.\n    The term “acyl-ACP thioesterase (TE)” refers to an enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of acyl-ACP to form a fatty acid, as shown in Scheme III and reference is also made to \n    FIG. 13, wherein R has the same meaning as set forth above:\n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    “FACS” refers to an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of the covalent complex between the acyl portion of the fatty acid and Coenzyme A as shown below in Scheme IV, wherein R has the same meaning as set forth above:\n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    The term “acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)” refers to an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA as shown below in Scheme V:\n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    Synthesis of Fatty Alcohols by an Acyl-CoA Independent Pathway:\n    \n    FIG. 13illustrates the biosynthetic pathways for fatty alcohol formation. FAR enzymes can act directly on fatty acyl-CoA substrates to form fatty alcohols. However, as described in more detail herein, the present inventors have discovered that the amount of fatty alcohols produced in certain microorganisms comprising a gene encoding a FAR encompassed by the invention and lacking a functional endogenous fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (FACS) is comparable to the amount of fatty alcohol produced by the microorganism that has a functional endogenous FACS gene. Referring to \n    FIG. 13, a recombinant microorganism that lacks a functional FACS gene does not catalyze the formation of fatty acyl-CoA substrates from fatty acids. Accordingly, the present inventors have posited that FAR enzymes (such as marine gammaproteobacterium FAR enzymes) as described herein catalyze the biosynthesis of fatty alcohols from fatty acyl-ACP substrates via an acyl-CoA independent pathway in lieu of, or in addition to, using fatty acyl-CoA substrates.\n    In certain embodiments, the present disclosure relates to the use of a FAR enzyme as described herein, e.g., a FAR enzyme from a marine bacterium, for producing a fatty alcohol composition. The discovery that FAR enzymes described herein utilized fatty acyl-ACP substrates instead of or in addition to, fatty acyl-CoA substrates provided for more efficient methods for producing fatty alcohol. In hosts, such as \n    E. coliwhich convert fatty acyl-ACP to fatty acyl-CoA via free fatty acids, the formation of fatty acyl-CoA complexes requires ATP. Thus, in the acyl-CoA independent pathway because production of fatty alcohols by FAR enzymes (e.g., marine bacterial FAR enzymes) from fatty acyl-ACP as described herein bypasses this step, less energy is used to form the fatty alcohol compositions. The present inventors' discovery of the mechanism of action of FARs as encompassed by the invention further allows for the production of fatty alcohols in recombinant cells that do not produce fatty acyl-CoA substrates or that produce low levels of the acyl-CoA substrates compared to wild-type or parent microorganisms. Accordingly fatty alcohols can be produced by a recombinant microorganism that lacks a functional endogenous enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acyl-CoA substrates. Thus in some aspects, fatty alcohols can be produced by a recombinant microorganism that express a gene encoding a FAR enzyme described herein and that lacks a gene encoding a fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (FACS) and/or a gene encoding a fatty acyl-ACP thioesterase (TE).\n    Thus, in some embodiments, the present disclosure provides for a mechanism of action for the production of fatty alcohols by an acyl-CoA independent pathway, wherein certain FAR enzymes encompassed by the invention may act on fatty acyl-ACP substrates in lieu of, or in addition to, acting on fatty acyl-CoA substrates, to produce fatty alcohols. In some embodiments of this aspect, the FAR enzymes from as encompassed by the invention herein including but not limited to FAR enzymes from \n    Marinobacterspecies, such as \n    Marinobacterspecies \n    algicola(DG893) and \n    Marinobacter aquaeolei, and \n    Oceanobacterspecies strain RED65 or functional fragments thereof can produce levels of fatty alcohols in the absence of, or in the presence of low levels of fatty acyl-CoA substrates, which were thought to be the main substrates of FAR enzymes that are comparable to the levels of fatty alcohols produced in the presence of normal levels of fatty acyl-CoA substrates. In further embodiments of this aspect, the invention relates to a recombinant host cell comprising a nucleic acid encoding a FAR enzyme according to the invention and an inactivated or silenced endogenous fatty acyl-ACP thioesterase gene, an inactivated or silenced endogenous fatty acyl-CoA synthetase gene or both. In some embodiments, the recombinant microorganisms provided herein above do not produce detectable levels of fatty acyl-CoA substrates and in other embodiments the recombinant microorganisms produce reduced levels of fatty acyl-CoA substrates as compared to wild-type cells.\n    In one preferred embodiment, fatty alcohols are produced by an acyl-CoA independent pathway comprising culturing a recombinant bacterial cells under suitable culture conditions, wherein the recombinant bacterial cell comprises a gene encoding a heterologous FAR polypeptide encompassed by the invention and wherein the recombinant bacterial cell comprises one or more endogenous polynucleotides that have been inactivated or silenced selected from a fadD gene, which codes for an acyl-CoA synthetase protein, a fadK gene, which codes for an endogenous short-chain acyl-CoA synthetase or both; allowing expression of the gene encoding the heterologous FAR enzyme and producing fatty alcohols by the conversion of fatty acyl-ACP substrates.\n    In certain embodiments, the recombinant host cell is an \n    E. colicell. In some embodiments of this aspect, the FAR enzymes are derived from \n    Marinobacter algicola(DG893), \n    Marinobacter aquaeolei, and \n    Oceanobacterspecies strain RED65 or functional fragments thereof. In certain embodiments, the FAR enzyme for use in the methods disclosed herein has an amino acid that has an amino acid sequence that is at least about 75% identical, at least about 80% identical, such as at least about 85% identical, such as at least about 90% identical, such as at least about 91%, such as at least about 92%, such as at least about 93%, such as at least about 94%, such as at least about 95%, such as at least about 96%, such as at least about 97%, such as at least about 98%, such as at least about 99% identical to the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 14, or functional fragments thereof.\n    Methods of Producing Fatty Alcohols and Compositions of Fatty Alcohols:\n    In various aspects of the present disclosure, fatty alcohols can be produced in cell-free systems. In certain embodiments, a FAR enzyme as described herein is provided with a substrate and all necessary cofactors to carry out the production of a fatty alcohol from a fatty acyl-thioesterase substrate. In certain aspects, fatty alcohols can be produced by recombinant microorganisms that express a heterologous FAR enzyme as described herein. In particular aspects, fatty alcohols can be produced by recombinant microorganisms that express a heterologous FAR enzyme and one or more proteins other than a FAR enzyme. In some embodiments, the fatty alcohols produced by the recombinant microorganisms are secreted into the nutrient medium. In other embodiments, the fatty alcohols produced by the recombinant microorganisms are extracted from the microorganisms.\n    In certain embodiments, the present disclosure relates to the use of a FAR enzyme as described herein, e.g., a FAR enzyme from a marine gamma proteobacterium, for producing a fatty alcohol composition in a cell-free system. In some embodiments, the FAR enzyme is provided with a substrate, e.g., a fatty acyl-thioester of the formula (I) and NAD(P)H under suitable conditions of temperature, pH, and ionic strength and time sufficient for the production of a fatty alcohol composition. In some embodiments, the FAR enzyme is provided with a composition of a fatty acid, Coenzyme A, ATP, NAD(P)H, and a fatty acyl-CoA synthase under suitable conditions of temperature, pH and ionic strength and time sufficient for production of the fatty acyl-CoA substrate of the FAR enzyme by the fatty acyl-CoA synthase and for production of a fatty alcohol composition from the fatty acyl-CoA substrate.\n    In certain embodiments of the present disclosure, a fatty alcohol composition is produced by a recombinant host cell comprising a heterologous gene encoding a FAR enzyme as described above, which is cultured in an aqueous nutrient medium comprising an assimilable source of carbon under conditions suitable for production of a fatty alcohol composition. In some embodiments, the fatty alcohol is produced by a recombinant host cell comprising a heterologous gene encoding a FAR enzyme as described above and the recombinant host cell comprises an inactivated or silenced gene selected from an acyl-ACP thioesterase and a fatty acyl-CoA synthetase.\n    In various embodiments, the recombinant host cell is a bacterium. In particular embodiments, the bacterium is \n    E. coli. In other embodiments, the recombinant host cell is a yeast. In particular embodiments, the yeast is \n    S. cerevisiae. In certain embodiments, the yeast is an oleaginous yeast. In certain particular embodiments, the oleaginous yeast is \n    Y. lipolytica.\n    In various embodiments, a fatty alcohol composition is produced by a recombinant host cell comprising a heterologous gene encoding a FAR enzyme from a marine bacterium and which over expresses a gene encoding one or more proteins that increases the rate at which the recombinant host cell produces the acyl-thioester FAR substrate, e.g., the compound of formula (I) above. In some embodiments, the one or more over expressed genes encode a protein directly involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. In particular embodiments, the one or more over expressed genes encode a protein selected from a fatty acid synthase (FAS), an acyl-ACP thioesterase (TE), a fatty acyl-CoA synthase (FACS) and an acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC).\n    “Culturing” or “cultivation” refers to growing a population of microbial cells under suitable conditions in a liquid or solid medium. In particular embodiments, culturing refers to the fermentative bioconversion of a substrate to an end-product. Culturing media are well known and individual components of such culture media are available from commercial sources, e.g., under the Difco™ and BBL™ trademarks. In one non-limiting example, the aqueous nutrient medium is a “rich medium” comprising complex sources of nitrogen, salts, and carbon, such as YP medium, comprising 10 g/L of peptone and 10 g/L yeast extract of such a medium.\n    In other non-limiting embodiments, the aqueous nutrient medium comprises a mixture of Yeast Nitrogen Base (Difco) supplemented with an appropriate mixture of amino acids, e.g. SC medium. In particular aspects of this embodiment, the amino acid mixture lacks one or more amino acids, thereby imposing selective pressure for maintenance of an expression vector within the recombinant host cell.\n    Fermentation of the recombinant host cell comprising a heterologous FAR gene for production of fatty alcohols is carried out under suitable conditions and for a time sufficient for production of fatty alcohols. Conditions for the culture and production of cells, including bacterial and yeast cells, are readily available. Cell culture media in general are set forth in Atlas and Parks (eds.) \n    The Handbook of Microbiological Media(1993) CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla., which is incorporated herein by reference. Additional information for cell culture is found in available commercial literature such as the \n    Life Science Research Cell Culture Catalogue(1998) from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc (St Louis, Mo.) (“Sigma-LSRCCC”) and, for example, \n    The Plant Culture Catalogueand supplement (1997) also from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc (St Louis, Mo.) (“Sigma-PCCS”), all of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n    In some embodiments, cells expressing the heterologous FAR genes as described herein are grown under batch or continuous fermentations conditions. Classical batch fermentation is a closed system, wherein the compositions of the medium is set at the beginning of the fermentation and is not subject to artificial alternations during the fermentation. A variation of the batch system is a fed-batch fermentation which also finds use in the present invention. In this variation, the substrate is added in increments as the fermentation progresses. Fed-batch systems are useful when catabolite repression is likely to inhibit the metabolism of the cells and where it is desirable to have limited amounts of substrate in the medium. Batch and fed-batch fermentations are common and well known in the art. Continuous fermentation is an open system where a defined fermentation medium is added continuously to a bioreactor and an equal amount of conditioned medium is removed simultaneously for processing. Continuous fermentation generally maintains the cultures at a constant high density where cells are primarily in log phase growth. Continuous fermentation systems strive to maintain steady state growth conditions. Methods for modulating nutrients and growth factors for continuous fermentation processes as well as techniques for maximizing the rate of product formation are well known in the art of industrial microbiology.\n    In some embodiments, fermentations are carried out a temperature within the range of from about 10° C. to about 60° C., from about 15° C. to about 50° C., from about 20° C. to about 45° C., and from about 25° C. to about 40° C. In a particular aspect, the fermentation is carried out at a temperature of from about 28° C. and also from about 30° C. In other embodiments, the fermentation is carried out for a period of time within the range of from about 8 hours to 240 hours, from about 8 hours to about 168 hours, from about 16 hours to about 144 hours, from about 16 hours to about 120 hours, or from about 24 hours to about 72 hours. It will be understood that, in certain embodiments where thermostable host cells are used, fermentations may be carried out at higher temperatures. In other embodiments, the fermentation will be carried out at a pH in the range of 4 to 8, in the range of 4.5 to 7.5, in the range of 5 to 7, and also in the range of 5.5 to 6.5.\n    Carbon sources useful in the aqueous fermentation medium or broth of the disclosed process in which the recombinant microorganisms are grown are those assimilable by the recombinant host strain. Assimilable carbon sources are available in many forms and include renewable carbon sources and the cellulosic and starch feedstock substrates obtained there from. Such examples include for example monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, succinate, acetate and mixtures thereof. Further carbon sources include, without limitation, glucose, galactose, sucrose, xylose, fructose, glycerol, arabinose, mannose, raffinose, lactose, maltose, and mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the term “fermentable sugars” is used interchangeably with the term “assimilable carbon source”. In one aspect, fermentation is carried out with a mixture of glucose and galactose as the assimilable carbon source. In another aspect, fermentation is carried out with glucose alone to accumulate biomass, after which the glucose is substantially removed and replaced with an inducer, e.g., galactose for induction of expression of one or more heterologous genes involved in fatty alcohol production. In still another aspect, fermentation is carried out with an assimilable carbon source that does not mediate glucose repression, e.g., raffinose, to accumulate biomass, after which the inducer, e.g., galactose, is added to induce expression of one or more heterologous genes involved in fatty alcohol production. In some preferred embodiments, the assimilable carbon source is from cellulosic and starch feedstock derived from but not limited to, wood, wood pulp, paper pulp, grain, corn stover, corn fiber, rice, paper and pulp processing waste, woody or herbaceous plants, fruit or vegetable pulp, distillers grain, grasses, rice hulls, wheat straw, cotton, hemp, flax, sisal, corn cobs, sugar cane bagasse, switch grass and mixtures thereof.\n    In various embodiments, the present disclosure relates to methods of producing a fatty alcohol composition comprising culturing a recombinant host cell comprising a gene expressing a heterologous FAR enzyme in an aqueous nutrient medium comprising an assimilable source of carbon under conditions in which a fatty alcohol composition of produced, and isolating the fatty alcohols.\n    In certain embodiments of the disclosed processes, at least 10%, such as at least 20%, such as at least 25%, such as at least 30%, such as at least 40%, such as at least 50%, such as at least 60%, such as at least 70%, such as at least 80%, such as at least 90% of the fatty alcohols produced by the methods described herein are secreted into the culture medium. In particular embodiments, when the recombinant microorganism is \n    E. coli, Yarrowia(e.g., \n    Y. lipolytica) or \n    Saccharomyces(e.g., \n    S. cerevisiae) at least 25% and also at least 50% of the fatty alcohols produced by the methods encompassed by the invention will be secreted into the culture medium.\n    In various embodiments, fatty alcohols produced by the methods of the invention are further recovered or isolated. Recovery or isolating the produced fatty alcohols refers to substantially separating the fatty alcohols from other components of the culture medium or fermentation process. Recovery or isolation may be by solvent extraction of the aqueous nutrient medium with a suitable water immiscible solvent. Extraction may occur simultaneously with fatty alcohol production and extraction may be continuous. Phase separation followed by solvent removal provides the fatty alcohol which may then be further purified and fractionated using methods and equipment known in the art. In other aspects of the disclosure, the secreted fatty alcohols coalesce to form a water immiscible phase that can be directly separated from the aqueous nutrient medium either during the fermentation or after its completion.\n    In some embodiments, less than 60%, less than about 50%, such as less than about 40%, such as less than about 30%, such as less than about 20%, such as less than about 10% of the fatty alcohols produced by the methods described herein are secreted from the recombinant host cells. In some embodiments, at least about 30%, such as at least about 40%, such as at least about 45%, such as at least about 50%, such as at least about 60%, such as at least about 65%, such as at least about than 70%, such as at least about 75%, such as a least about 80%, such as at least about 85%, such as at least about 90% of the fatty alcohols produced by the methods described herein are secreted from the recombinant host cells. In certain embodiments, fatty alcohols are isolated by separating the cells from the aqueous nutrient medium, for example by centrifugation, resuspension and extraction of the fatty alcohols from the recombinant host cells using an organic solvent or solvent mixture. Suitable protocols for recovering fatty alcohols from recombinant host cells and/or culture medium are known to the skilled artisan. In some embodiments, fatty alcohols may be recovered by first lysing the cells to release the fatty alcohols and then extracting the fatty alcohol from the lysate using conventional means.

Fatty alcohol compositions produced by the methods described herein may also include fatty acid derived components, such as but not limited to esters (e.g. acetate and waxes) and fatty acids.\n    Methods of Producing Alkane and/or Alkene Compositions:\n    In various embodiments, the fatty alcohol compositions produced by the methods described herein are subjected to reduction to produce alkanes and/or alkenes having the same carbon chain length as the fatty alcohol starting materials. Without being bound by any particular theory, the hydroxyl group of an alcohol is a poor leaving group, and therefore, in principle a chemical moiety that binds to the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group to make it a better leaving group can be used to reduce the fatty alcohols described herein.\n    Any method known in the art can be used to reduce the fatty alcohols present in the compositions described herein. In some embodiments, reduction of fatty alcohols can be carried out chemically, for example, by a Barton deoxygenation (or Barton-McCombie deoxygenation), a two-step reaction in which the alcohol is first converted to a methyl xanthate or thioimidazoyl carbamate, and the xanthate or thioimidazoyl carbamate is reduced with a tin hydride or trialkylsilane reagent under radical conditions to produce the alkane and/or alkene. See J. J. Li, C. Limberakis, D. A. Pflum \n    Modern Organic Synthesis in the Laboratory(Oxford University Press, 2007) at pp. 81-83.\n    In some embodiments, reduction of fatty alcohols to the corresponding alkanes and/or alkenes can be accomplished using a microorganism that has a biosynthetic pathway for reducing fatty alcohols.

Esterification reactions of fatty alcohols are well-known in the art. In certain embodiments, the transesterification reaction is carried out in the presence of a strong catalyst, e.g., a strong alkaline such as sodium hydroxide. In other embodiments, the reaction is carried out enzymatically using an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of fatty alcohols to acid esters, such as lipoprotein lipase. See, e.g., Tsujita et al.

Construction of Vectors to Express FARs in \n    E. coli\n    The FAR genes were cloned into the vector pCK110900 (shown in FIG. 3 of US Patent Publication No. 2006/0195947) under the control of a lac promoter using the Sfi I restriction sites. The expression vector also contained the P15a origin of replication and the chloramphenicol resistance gene. The resulting plasmids were introduced into \n    E. coliBW25113 (ΔfadE) (Baba et al., Molecular Systems Biology, 2006 doi:10,1038/msb4100050, Article Number: 2006.0008) using routine transformation methods.\n    b. In Vivo Activity of FARs in Recombinant \n    E. coliUsing Shake Flasks\n    Recombinant \n    E. colihost strains comprising a plasmid containing a heterologous gene encoding either the \n    B. mori, M. algicolaDG893, \n    M. aquaeoleior \n    Oceanobactersp. RED65 fatty acyl-CoA reductase, were grown in Luria Bertani Broth (LB) medium supplemented with 1% glucose and 30 μg/mL chloramphenicol (CAM), for approximately 16-18 hours (overnight) at 30° C., 200 rpm. A 5% inoculum was used to initiate fresh 50 mL 2xYT Broth culture supplemented with 30 μg/mL CAM and 0-0.4% glucose. The culture was incubated in a shaker for 2.5 hours at 30° C. and 200 rpm to an OD\n    600of about 0.6 to about 0.8, at which point expression of the heterologous FAR was induced with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) (1 mM final concentration). Incubation was continued for about 16 hours (overnight) under the same conditions. Cells were collected by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 6000 rpm in F15B-8×50C rotor. The cell pellets were resuspended in 0.5 mL of 6.7% Na\n    2SO\n    4and then extracted with 1 mL of isopropanol:methyl t-butyl ether (4/6 ratio) for 2 hrs. The extract was centrifuged and analyzed either directly by GC-FID or GC-MS or derivatized with BSTFA before analysis. For derivatization, a 400 μL sample was taken off the top organic layer, evaporated under a nitrogen stream and the residue was derivatized with 100 μL N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide) (BSTFA) at 37° C. for 1 hour, and then diluted with 100 μL of heptanes before analysis by GC-FID or GC-MS. 0.5 mL of the culture medium (after removal of cells by centrifugation) was also extracted with 1 mL methyl t-butyl ether for 1 hr. The organic phase was either analyzed directly by GC-FID or GC-MS or derivatized with BSTFA as described above before analysis. In addition, 0.5 mL of the cell culture (before removal of cells by centrifugation) was directly extracted with 1 mL of isopropanol:hexane (4:6 ratio) for 2 hrs. The organic phase was either analyzed directly by GC-FID or GC-MS or derivatized with BSTFA as described above before analysis.\n    A 1 μL sample was analyzed by GC-FID with the split ratio 1:10 using the following conditions: GC-6890N from Agilent Technologies equipped with FID detector and HP-5 column (length 30 m, I.D. 0.32 mm, film 0.25 μm). GC method: start at 100° C., increase the temperature with a rate of 25° C./min to 246° C. and hold for 1.96 min. Total run time, 7.8 min. Under the above GC conditions the approximate retention times (min) of produced fatty alcohols and acids are as follows: 5.08, C14:0-OH; 5.40; C14:0-OOH; 5.74, C16:1-OH, 5.93; C16:0-OH, 6.11; C16:0-OOMe (internal standard); 6.16, C16:1-OOH, 6.29; C16:0-OOH, 6.80; C18:1-OH, 6.90; C18:0-OH, 7.3; C18:0- and C18:1-OOH. Under the conditions tested, expression of the \n    B. mori, M. algicolaDG893 and \n    Oceanobactersp. RED65, FARs in \n    E. coliBW25113 ΔfadE resulted production of fatty alcohols (see Table 2). Identification of individual fatty alcohol was done by comparison to commercial standards (Sigma Chemical Company, 6050 Spruce St. Louis, Mo. 63103). In addition the total production of fatty alcohols by FAR_Maq was similar to that obtained from FAR_Maa (\n    M. algicolaDG893) and produced fatty alcohols include C14:0 (2.5%), C16:1 (10%), C16:0 (34%), C18:1 (53%) and C18:0 (0.5%).\n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n            \n              TABLE 2\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              Fatty alcohol profile exhibited by recombinant \n              E. coliBW25113 ΔfadE\n            \n            \n              host cells over expressing heterologous FAR genes\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n            \n              \n              Fatty alcohol composition\n              a\n              Total\n              b\n              Secreted\n              b\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n            \n              FAR Enzyme\n              C12:0\n              C14:0\n              C16:1\n              C16:0\n              C18:1\n              C18:0\n              (mg/L)\n              (mg/L)\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n            \n              \n                B. mori\n              \n              <10\n              <10\n              <10\n              >40\n              10-20\n              <10\n              2\n              ND\n            \n            \n              \n                Oceanobacter\n              \n              ND\n              3\n              10\n              33\n              54\n              ND\n              320\n              220\n            \n            \n              RED65\n            \n            \n              \n                M. algicola\n              \n              ND\n              8\n              30\n              30\n              32\n              ND\n              820\n              720\n            \n            \n              DG893\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              aThe relative amounts of each fatty alcohol component are expressed as a % of the total fatty alcohols detected via GC-FID.

In Vivo Activity of FARs in Recombinant \n    E. coliUsing Fermentors\n    In an aerated, agitated stirred tank fermentor, 1.0 L of growth medium containing 11.28 g/L 5×M9 minimal salts (BD, Franklin Lakes, N.J.); 2 g/L yeast extract (BD, Franklin Lakes, N.J.); 3 g/L glucose (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.); 2 mM MgSO\n    4(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.); 0.1 mM CaCl\n    2(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.); and 30 μg/ml chloroamphenicol (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) was brought to a temperature of 30° C. The fermentor was inoculated with a late exponential culture of \n    E. coliBW25113 ΔfadE equipped with plasmid containing \n    M. algicolaDG893 (as described in Example 2b) to a starting optical density at 600 nm (OD\n    600) of 0.8 to 1.0. The inoculum was grown in a shake flask containing TB (BD, Franklin Lakes, N.J.); 0.4% glycerol (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.), and 30 μg/ml chloroamphenicol (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) at 30° C. and 250 rpm until OD600 reached around 5.0. The fermentor was agitated at 400-1000 rpm and air supplied at 1.0 L/min to maintain a minimum dissolved oxygen level of 30% of saturation. The pH of the culture was controlled at 7.0 initially by addition of mixture of 14% v/v ammonium hydroxide and 10% w/v sodium hydroxide. The base for pH control was switched to 20% w/v sodium hydroxide when ammonium concentration in the broth reached 1.5-2.0 g/L. After the culture reached an OD\n    600of 5.0, the expression of \n    M. algicolaDG893 FAR was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) (Sigma Chemical Corp., St. Louis, Mo.) to a final concentration of 1 mM. Growth of the culture and production of fatty alcohol were maintained by addition of a feed solution containing 500 g/L glucose. Addition of glucose (6 g/L per pulse) was triggered whenever pH reached 7.2. Culture was then grown for another 135-140 hours at 30° C. 3 g/L yeast extract shots were added at 55 and 95 hours. Samples were taken at different time points for analysis. Extraction and quantification of fatty alcohols were performed as described in Example 2b. Under the conditions tested, total production and secretion of fatty alcohols were estimated to be ˜12-15 and 9-13 g/L, respectively.\n    Example 3\n    Expression and Activity of FAR Enzymes in Various \n    E. coliStrains\n    a.

RED65 fatty acyl reductase (FAR), were grown on Luria Bertani (LB) medium supplements with 1% glucose and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol (CAM) for approximately 16-18 hours (overnight) at 30° C., 200 rpm. A 5% inoculums was used to initiate fresh 50 mL LB culture supplemented with 30 μg/mL CAM. The culture was incubated for 2.5 hrs at 30° C. and 200 rpm to an OD600 of 0.6-0.8, at which point expression of the heterologous FAR gene was induced with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) (1 mM final concentration). Incubation was continued for about 24 hours under the same conditions. Extraction and quantitation of fatty alcohols were performed as described in Example 2b except the use of following GC method: start at 80° C. for 3 mins, increase the temperature at a rate of 50° C./min to 200° C., then increase the temperature at a rate of 10° C./min to 270° C. and finally, increase at 20° C./min to 300° C. and hold for 5 min (total rum time 18.8 min). Under the above GC conditions the approximate retention times (mins) of produced fatty alcohols and acids were as follows: 6.90, C12:0-OH; 8.04, C14:0-OH; 8.42, d27-C14:0-OOH (internal standard); 8.53, C14:0-OOH; 9.11, C16:1-OH; 9.23, C16:0-OH; 9.68, C16:1-OOH, 9.80; C16:0-OOH; 10; 46, C18:1-OH; 10.57, C18:0-OH; 11.10, C18:1-OOH, and 11.25, C18:0-OOH.

RED65 FAR in \n    E. coliBW25113 and the corresponding ΔfadD, ΔfadE and ΔfadK strains resulted in production of fatty alcohols (Tables 3a and 3b). Typical shake flask titer for \n    E. coliBW25113 expressing \n    M. algicolaDG893 and \n    Oceanobactersp. RED65 FARs was 100-200 mg/L. Since both FARs are able to produce significant amounts of fatty alcohols in the absence of the fadD and fadK acyl-CoA synthetases in \n    E. coli, these FARs are able to reduce non acyl-CoA substrates.\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n              \n                TABLE 3A\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n              \n              \n                Fatty alcohol profile exhibited by recombinant \n                E.colihost cells expressing a\n              \n              \n                heterologous \n                M.\n                algicolaFAR gene\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                \n                Relative production\n              \n              \n                \n                \n                of fatty\n              \n              \n                Recombinant \n                E.colicells\n                Deleted protein\n                alcohols\n                a\n              \n              \n                \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                BW25113\n                —\n                1.0\n              \n              \n                BW25113 ΔfadE\n                Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase\n                1.0\n              \n              \n                BW25113 ΔfadD\n                Acyl-CoA synthetase\n                0.78\n              \n              \n                BW25113 ΔfadKlydiD\n                Short chain acyl-CoA\n                0.64\n                b\n              \n              \n                \n                synthetase, anaerobic\n              \n              \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                aFatty alcohols include: 15-17% C14:0 (1-tetradeconal), approximately 38% C16:1 (cis Δ\n                9-1-hexadeconal), 23-24% C16:0 (1-hexacecanol), 21-22% C18:1 (cis Δ\n                11-1-octadeconal), 0-1% C18:0 (1-octadecanol).\n              \n              \n                \n                bData obtained from evaluation of strains in microtiter plates.\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n            \n              TABLE 3B\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              Fatty alcohol profile exhibited by recombinant \n              E.colihost cells expressing a\n            \n            \n              heterologous Oceanobacter sp.

Construction of Vectors to Express FARs in \n    Yarrowia lipolytica\n    An autonomous replicating plasmid for expression of genes in \n    Y. lipolyticawas engineered with two antibiotic selection marker cassettes for resistance to hygromycin and phleomycin (HygB(R) or Ble(R), respectively) (named plasmid pCEN354). Expression of each cassette was independently regulated by a strong, constitutive promoter isolated from \n    Y. lipolytica: pTEF1 for Ble(R) expression and pRPS7 for HygB(R) expression. Plasmid pCEN354 was used to assemble \n    Y. lipolyticaexpression plasmids. Using “restriction free cloning” methodology, the FAR gene was inserted into pCEN354 to provided plasmid pCEN411 (\n    FIG. 1). In pCEN411, heterologous gene expression is under control of the constitutive TEF1 promoter. The HygB\n    Rgene allows for selection in media containing hygromycin. Ars18 is an autonomous replicating sequence isolated from \n    Y. lipolyticagenomic DNA. The resulting plasmid was transformed into \n    Y. lipolytica1345 obtained from the German Resource Centre for Biological Material (DSMZ) using routine transformation methods [(Madzak, C. et al. (2003) \n    Yarrowia lipolytica. In G. Gellissen (Ed.), \n    Production of Recombinant Proteins Novel Microbial and Eukaryotic Expression Systems(p 163-189).].\n    b. In Vivo Activity of Heterologous \n    M. algicolaFAR in Recombinant \n    Y. lipolyticaUsing Shake Flasks\n    The recombinant \n    Y. lipolyticastrain comprising plasmid containing a heterologous gene encoding \n    M. algicolaDG893 FAR, was inoculated in 200 mL YPD media containing 8% glucose and 500 μg/mL hygromycin. The cultures were grown at 30° C. to an OD600 of 4-7. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation and washed with 20 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5. Extraction and identification of intra- and extra-cellular fatty alcohols were performed as described in Example 2b. Under the conditions tested 14 mg/L of 1-hexadecanol was detected. Secreted fatty alcohols were not detected. Using 8% glycerol as carbon source, the total production and secretion of fatty alcohols was estimated to be ˜0.8 and 0.2 g/L, respectively. Fatty alcohols include: 30% C16:0 (1-hexahecanol), 56% 18:0 (1-octadecanol) and 12% C18:1 (cis Δ\n    9-1-octadecenol).\n    c. In Vivo Activity of Integrated \n    M. algicolaFAR in \n    Y. lipolyticaGenome Using 96-Well Microtiter Plates\n    An improved \n    Y. lipolyticastrain (YL1415) for production of fatty alcohols was identified from a library of UV-mutagenized strains defective in growth on media with hexadecane as the sole carbon source. When transformed with pCEN411, YL1415 strain showed 7-10-fold increase in fatty alcohol titer and a significant reduction in the rate of degradation of exogenous 1-hexadecanol in YPD media containing 8% glucose and 500 μg/mL hygromycin compared to that detected from \n    Y. lipolytica1345. Expression of \n    M. algicolaDG893 FAR was improved in the YL1415 strain by integrating the \n    M. algicolaDG893 FAR gene at random locations in the genome by non-homologous recombination. An integration cassette consisting of \n    M. algicolaFAR under control of the TEF promoter and the HygBR gene under control of the RPS promoter was amplified from pCEN411 using primers 411-F1 (AGAGACCGGGTTGGCGG) (SEQ ID NO: 17) and 411-R1 (CATTTGCCATTCGTAACGCTG) (SEQ ID NO: 18).\n    Transformation of YL1415 with this integration cassette yielded a library of hygromycin-resistant strains with FAR integrated at various locations in the \n    Y. lipolyticagenome [(Madzak, C. et al. (2003) \n    Yarrowia lipolytica. In G. Gellissen (Ed.), \n    Production of Recombinant Proteins Novel Microbial and Eukaryotic Expression Systems(p 163-189)]. This collection of strains with integrated \n    M. algicolaDG893 FAR in the YL1415 UV mutant strain was grown in 96-well Axygen 96-well plates containing 250 μL YPD supplemented with the total of 2% glucose and 500 μg/mL hygromycin. Plates were incubated in a Kuhner shaker for approximately 40-48 hours at 30° C., 200 rpm and 85% relative humidity. The cell cultures were diluted by transferring 50 μL of overnight grown cultures into the Axygen 96-well plates containing 250 μL YPD supplemented with the total of 2% glucose and 500 μg/mL hygromycin. The plates were incubated for approximately 24-28 hours in a Kuhner shaker under the similar conditions. 20 μL of the cell cultures were then transferred into deep 96-well plates containing 380 μL YPD supplemented with the total of 8% glucose and 500 μg/mL hygromycin. The Ppates were incubated for approximately 22-26 hours under similar conditions. Cells were collected by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 3500 rpm. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 400 μL of nitrogen limitation media (1.7 g/L yeast nitrogen base, 1.4 g/L (NH\n    4)\n    2SO\n    4, 30 g/L glucose) containing 500 μg/mL Hygromycin and incubated for 22-26 hours in a Kuhner shaker at 30° C., 200 rpm and 85% relative humidity. The cell cultures were then extracted with 1 mL of isopropanol:hexane (4:6 ratio) for 2 hrs. The extracts were centrifuged and the upper organic phase was transferred into polypropylene 96-well plates. Samples were then analyzed using GC-FID method as described in Example 2b. Under the conditions tested, \n    M. algicolaFAR integrant strains with up to ˜5× improvement in total fatty alcohol production (˜0.5-1 g/L) compared to plasmid-based expression were identified. Fatty alcohols include: 70-80% C16:0 (1-hexahecanol), 10-15% 18:0 (1-octadecanol) and 10-15% C18:1 (cis Δ\n    9-1-octadecenol).\n    All publications, patents, patent applications and other documents cited in this application are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties for all purposes to the same extent as if each individual publication, patent, patent application or other document were individually indicated to be incorporated by reference for all purposes.\n    While various specific embodiments have been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention(s).","lang":"en"}],"assignees":[{"country":"US","number":1,"upper_name":"CODEXIS, INC.","city":"Redwood City","name":"CODEXIS, INC.","state":"CA"}],"titles":[{"text":"PRODUCTION OF FATTY ALCOHOLS WITH FATTY ALCOHOL FORMING ACYL-COA REDUCTASES (FAR)","lang":"en"}],"govt_interest":[{"lang":"en"}],"id":"US20110000125","data_source":"USPTO","drawing_description":[{"text":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\n      \n      FIG. 1shows the replicative \n      Y. lipolyticavector pCEN411 (approximately 9065 bp) containing cassettes encoding hygromycin (HygB) resistance and FAR expression.

The electronic copy of the Sequence Listing was created Jun. 28, 2010, and the size on disk is 82 Kbytes.\n    BACKGROUND\n    Diesel fuel is any fuel used in diesel engines and includes both petrodiesel and biodiesel. Petrodiesel is a specific fractional distillate of fossil fuel oil. It is comprised of about 75% saturated hydrocarbons and 25% aromatic hydrocarbons. Biodiesel is not derived from petroleum but from vegetable oil or animal fats and contains long chain alkyl esters. Biodiesel is made by the transesterification of lipids (e.g., spent vegetable oil from fryers or seed oils) with an alcohol and burns cleaner than petrodiesel. Biodiesel can be used alone or mixed with petrodiesel in any amount for use in modern engines.\n    Kerosene is a combustible hydrocarbon that is also a specific fractional distillate of fossil fuel and contains hydrocarbons having 6 to 16 carbon atoms. Kerosene has a heat of combustion comparable to that of petrodiesel and is widely used in jet fuel to power jet engines and for heating in certain countries. Kerosene-based fuels can also be burned with liquid oxygen and used as rocket fuel (e.g., RP-1).\n    Reliance on petroleum-derived fuels has depleted the supply of natural resources and has required increased reliance on imported gasoline and diesel products. In addition, the burning of petroleum-based fuels has increased the amount of greenhouse gasses (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane) in the atmosphere that is contributing to the gradual warming of the earth's climate.\n    Fuels, such as biodiesel, that are made from animal or vegetable products burn cleaner than petroleum-derived fuels and do not produce a net increase in greenhouse gases. Furthermore, they are a sustainable energy source and have the potential to reduce the United States' reliance on imported petroleum-based products. However, there is a concern that using land to produce fuel crops rather than food crops will contribute to world hunger.\n    Fatty acids are the principle component of cell membranes and are used by nearly all organisms as a primary source of energy storage. Fatty alcohols are the reduction products of fatty acids and, like fatty acids, can be produced enzymatically by cultured cells. Fatty alcohols can be reacted with acids to form ester compositions similar to those present in biodiesel fuel, or reduced to form kerosene-like compositions, or hydrocarbon compositions similar to petrodiesel. Enzymes that convert fatty acyl-thioester substrates (e.g., fatty acyl-CoA or fatty acyl-ACP) to fatty alcohols are commonly referred to as fatty alcohol forming acyl-CoA reductases or fatty acyl reductases (“FARs”).\n    PCT Publication No. WO 2007/136762 discloses genetically engineered microorganisms for the production of fatty acid derivatives and methods of their use.\n    PCT Publication No. WO 2009/140695 discloses compositions comprising cyanobacterial genes encoding enzymes involved in hydrocarbon biosynthesis and methods of using then in the production of aldehydes and alcohols.\n    Steen et al., 2010, Nature 463:559-563 discloses the engineering of \n    E. colito produce specific fatty esters, fatty alcohols and waxes directly from simple sugars.\n    Schirmer, 2009, Current Opinion in Microbiology 12:274-281 describes the fermentative and nonfermentative metabolism of heterotrophic microorganisms used in the production of fuel-like molecules, biocatalysts that convert metabolic intermediates into fuel-like molecules, and the parameters that govern the cost effective production of such fuel-like molecules.\n    U.S. Pat.

However, when expressed in heterologous hosts such as \n    E. coliand yeast, the yields of fatty alcohols obtained have been insufficient for certain applications. In addition, at most, only a small fraction of the produced fatty alcohols are secreted by the microorganisms, increasing substantially the cost of purification.\n    Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for enzymes such as FAR enzymes that can be used to efficiently produce fatty alcohols for use in industrial applications such as, but not limited to applications in the food industry, cosmetic industry, medical industry, and fuels industry.\n    SUMMARY\n    The present disclosure provides isolated fatty acyl reductase (FAR) enzymes, nucleic acids encoding the FAR enzymes, recombinant microorganisms engineered to express the FAR enzymes, methods of producing fatty alcohols and other compositions utilizing the FAR enzymes and/or recombinant microorganisms, and compositions comprising and/or that are derived from the fatty alcohols. The various inventions described herein are based, in part, on the inventors' surprising discovery that certain genera of the class of gammaproteobacteria found in seawater contain FAR enzymes that are capable of generating high yields of total and secreted fatty alcohols when expressed in heterologous cells.\n    In particular, the present inventors have discovered that \n    Marinobacterspecies \n    algicola(strain DG893) (“FAR_Maa”), \n    Marinobacter aquaeoleiVT8 (“FAR_Maq”), and \n    Oceanobacterspecies strain RED65 (recently reclassified as \n    Bermanella marisrubriRED65) (“FAR_Ocs”) possess FAR enzymes capable of producing approximately 150- to 400-times more total fatty alcohol, respectively, than FAR enzymes from \n    B. mori, when expressed in an \n    E. colihost. Significantly greater yields of fatty alcohols are also achieved in yeast. Based on this surprising discovery, it is expected that other genera of marine bacteria and particularly marine gammaproteobacteria will likewise contain FAR enzymes that are especially suitable for the production of fatty alcohols, especially when expressed in heterologous host microorganisms. In certain embodiments, FAR enzymes that are especially suitable for the production of fatty alcohols may be identified using Hidden Markov Models (“HMMs”), which identify proteins by similarity to patterns found in pre-complied sets of protein sequences. The patterns inherent in each pre-complied set are encapsulated in HMMs. It is the HMM for a given sequence set that defines a protein domain or protein family. Using this technique it is possible to classify portions of a given protein sequence that share common domains with previously-identified suitable FAR enzymes. See, e.g., http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/. In certain embodiments, the HMMs are used to identify NAD binding domains and/or sterile domains.\n    Accordingly, in one aspect the present disclosure provides isolated FAR enzymes derived from or obtained from marine bacteria, such as marine gammaproteobacteria, and/or functional fragments thereof having FAR activity. In some embodiments, the FAR enzyme is isolated directly from the marine gammaproteobacteria in which it occurs naturally. In some embodiments, the FAR enzyme and/or a function fragment is isolated from a heterologous host microorganism engineered to express the FAR enzyme or functional fragment.\n    In another aspect, the present invention relates to a FAR enzyme and functional fragment thereof derived or obtained from \n    M. algicolastrain DG893.

Generally, the nomenclature used herein and the laboratory procedures of cell culture, molecular genetics, organic chemistry, analytical chemistry and nucleic acid chemistry described below are those well known and commonly employed in the art.\n    As used herein, the following terms are intended to have the following meanings: The following abbreviations are used herein: “FAR” denotes fatty acyl reductase or fatty alcohol forming acyl-CoA reductase; “ACP” denotes acyl carrier protein; “CoA” denotes coenzyme A; “TE” denotes thioesterase; “FAS” denotes fatty acid synthase; “FACR” denotes fatty acyl-CoA reductase; “FACS” denotes fatty acyl-CoA synthase (synthetase) and acyl-CoA synthase (synthetase) as used interchangeably herein; and “ACC” denotes acetyl-CoA carboxylase.\n    “Fatty alcohol forming acyl-CoA reductase” or “fatty acyl reductase” as used interchangeably herein refers to an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of a fatty acyl-CoA, a fatty acyl-ACP, or other fatty acyl thioester complex to a fatty alcohol, which is linked to the oxidation of NAD(P)H to NAD(P)\n    +, as shown in Scheme I:\n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    wherein “R” represents a C8 to C24 saturated, unsaturated, linear, branched or cyclic hydrocarbon, and “R\n    1” represents CoA, ACP or other fatty acyl thioester substrates. CoA is a non-protein acyl carrier group factor (or moiety) involved in the synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids. “ACP” is a polypeptide or protein subunit of fatty acid synthase used in the synthesis of fatty acids. FARs are distinct from FACRs. FACRs reduce only fatty acyl-CoA intermediates to fatty aldehydes and require an additional oxidoreductase enzyme to generate the corresponding fatty alcohol. “Fatty aldehyde” as used herein refers to a saturated or unsaturated aliphatic aldehyde and reference is made to \n    FIG. 13, wherein R is as defined above.\n    The term “fatty acid” as used herein refers to a compound of formula III:\n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    wherein “R” is as defined above. Saturated or unsaturated fatty acids can be described as “Ca:b”, wherein “a” is an integer that represents the total number of carbon atoms and “b” is an integer that refers to the number of double bonds in the carbon chain.\n    The term “fatty alcohol” as used herein refers to an aliphatic alcohol of the formula (II) wherein R is as defined above. Saturated or unsaturated fatty alcohols can be described as “Ca:b-OH”, wherein “a” is an integer that represents the total number of carbon atoms in the fatty alcohol and “b” is an integer that refers to the number of double bonds in carbon chain.\n    Unsaturated fatty acids or fatty alcohols can be referred to as “cis Δ\n    x” or “trans Δ\n    x” wherein “cis” and “trans” refer to the carbon chain configuration around the double bond and “x” indicates the number of the first carbon of the double bond, wherein carbon 1 is the carboxylic acid carbon of the fatty acid or the carbon bound to the —OH group of the fatty alcohol.\n    The term “fatty acyl-thioester” or “fatty acyl-thioester complex” refers to a compound of formula (I), wherein a fatty acyl moiety is covalently linked via a thioester linkage to a carrier moiety. Fatty acyl-thioesters are substrates for the FAR enzymes described herein.\n    The term “fatty acyl-CoA” refers to a compound of formula (I) wherein R\n    1is Coenzyme A.\n    The term “fatty acyl-ACP” refers to a compound of formula (I) wherein R\n    1is acyl carrier protein.\n    The phrase “acyl-CoA independent pathway” refers to the production of fatty alcohols by the direct enzymatic conversion of fatty acyl-ACP substrates to fatty alcohols and does not involve the use of free fatty acids or fatty acyl-CoA intermediates. This biosynthetic pathway differs from a) the fatty acyl-CoA dependent pathway which converts fatty acyl-ACP directly to fatty acyl CoA via an acyl-transfer reaction, such as in yeast, and b) the fatty acyl-CoA dependent pathway which converts fatty acyl-ACP to fatty acyl-CoA via a free fatty acid intermediate, such as in bacteria and reference is made to \n    FIG. 13.\n    The acyl-CoA independent pathway has the advantage of bypassing the step of form a fatty acyl-CoA substrate from free fatty acid, which requires the use of ATP. Therefore, the acyl-CoA independent pathway may use less energy than the acyl-CoA dependent pathway that utilizes a free fatty acid intermediate.\n    “Conversion” refers to the enzymatic conversion of the substrate to the corresponding product. “Percent conversion” refers to the percent of the substrate that is reduced to the product within a period of time under specified conditions. Thus, the “enzymatic activity” or “activity” of a polypeptide can be expressed as “percent conversion” of the substrate to the product.\n    “Percentage of sequence identity,” “percent identity” and “percentage homology” are used interchangeably herein to refer to comparisons among polynucleotides and polypeptides, and are determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) as compared to the reference sequence (which may also contain gaps to optimize the alignment) for alignment of the two sequences. The percentage may be calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison (including positions where one of the sequences has a gap) and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. Alternatively, the percentage may be calculated by determining the number of positions at which either the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences or a nucleic acid base or amino acid residue is aligned with a gap to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. Those of skill in the art appreciate that there are many established algorithms available to align two sequences and that different methods may give slightly different results.\n    Alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, e.g., by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, 1981, Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482, by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443, by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman, 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444, by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the GCG Wisconsin Software Package), or by visual inspection (see generally, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, F. M. Ausubel et al., eds., Current Protocols, a joint venture between Greene Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., (1995 Supplement) (Ausubel)). The Clustral (Chema R., Sugawara H., Koike T., Lopez R., Gibson T. J., Higgins D. G., Thompson J. D., (2003) Multiple sequence alignment with the Clustral series of programs, Nucleic Acids Res., 31, 3497-3500.) and T-Coffee (T-COFFEE: A novel method for multiple sequence alignments. Notredame, Higgins, Heringa, J M B 302 (205-217) 2000 software packages may also be used to align sequences.\n    Examples of algorithms that are suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in Altschul et al., 1990, J. Mol. Biol. 215: 403-410 and Altschul et al., 1977, Nucleic Acids Res. 3389-3402, respectively. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information website. This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as, the neighborhood word score threshold (Altschul et al, supra). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are then extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always >0) and N (penalty score for mismatching residues; always <0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when: the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, an expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=−4, and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 3, an expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff and Henikoff, 1989, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 89:10915). Exemplary determination of sequence alignment and % sequence identity can employ the BESTFIT or GAP programs in the GCG Wisconsin Software package (Accelrys, Madison Wis.), using default parameters provided.\n    “Reference sequence” refers to a defined sequence used as a basis for a sequence comparison. A reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence, for example, a segment of a full-length gene or polypeptide sequence. Generally, a reference sequence is at least 20 nucleotide or amino acid residues in length, at least 25 residues in length, at least 50 residues in length, or the full length of the nucleic acid or polypeptide. Since two polynucleotides or polypeptides may each (1) comprise a sequence (i.e., a portion of the complete sequence) that is similar between the two sequences, and (2) may further comprise a sequence that is divergent between the two sequences, sequence comparisons between two (or more) polynucleotides or polypeptide are typically performed by comparing sequences of the two polynucleotides over a “comparison window” to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity.\n    “Comparison window” refers to a conceptual segment of at least about 20 contiguous nucleotide positions or amino acids residues wherein a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of at least 20 contiguous nucleotides or amino acids and wherein the portion of the sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) of 20 percent or less as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The comparison window can be longer than 20 contiguous residues, and includes, optionally 30, 40, 50, 100, or longer windows.\n    “Conservative” amino acid substitutions or mutations refer to the interchangeability of residues having similar side chains, and thus typically involves substitution of the amino acid in the polypeptide with amino acids within the same or similar defined class of amino acids. However, as used herein, conservative mutations do not include substitutions from a hydrophilic to hydrophilic, hydrophobic to hydrophobic, hydroxyl-containing to hydroxyl-containing, or small to small residue, if the conservative mutation can instead be a substitution from an aliphatic to an aliphatic, non-polar to non-polar, polar to polar, acidic to acidic, basic to basic, aromatic to aromatic, or constrained to constrained residue. Further, as used herein, A, V, L, or I can be conservatively mutated to either another aliphatic residue or to another non-polar residue. Table 1 below shows exemplary conservative substitutions.\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n              \n                TABLE 1\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n              \n              \n                Conservative Substitutions\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                Residue\n                Possible Conservative Mutations\n              \n              \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                A, L, V, I\n                Other aliphatic (A, L, V, I)\n              \n              \n                \n                \n                Other non-polar (A, L, V, I, G, M)\n              \n              \n                \n                G, M\n                Other non-polar (A, L, V, I, G, M)\n              \n              \n                \n                D, E\n                Other acidic (D, E)\n              \n              \n                \n                K, R\n                Other basic (K, R)\n              \n              \n                \n                P, H\n                Other constrained (P, H)\n              \n              \n                \n                N, Q, S, T\n                Other polar (N, Q, S, T)\n              \n              \n                \n                Y, W, F\n                Other aromatic (Y, W, F)\n              \n              \n                \n                C\n                None\n              \n              \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    “Non-conservative substitution” refers to substitution or mutation of an amino acid in the polypeptide with an amino acid with significantly differing side chain properties. Non-conservative substitutions may use amino acids between, rather than within, the defined groups listed above. In one embodiment, a non-conservative mutation affects (a) the structure of the peptide backbone in the area of the substitution (e.g., proline for glycine) (b) the charge or hydrophobicity, or (c) the bulk of the side chain.\n    “Deletion” refers to modification to the polypeptide by removal of one or more amino acids from the reference polypeptide. Deletions can comprise removal of 1 or more amino acids, 2 or more amino acids, 5 or more amino acids, 10 or more amino acids, 15 or more amino acids, or 20 or more amino acids, up to 10% of the total number of amino acids, or up to 20% of the total number of amino acids making up the reference enzyme while retaining enzymatic activity and/or retaining the improved properties of an engineered enzyme. Deletions can be directed to the internal portions and/or terminal portions of the polypeptide. In various embodiments, the deletion can comprise a continuous segment or can be discontinuous. The term “deletion” is also used to refer to a DNA modification in which one or more nucleotides or nucleotide base-pairs have been removed, as compared to the corresponding reference, parental or “wild type” DNA.\n    “Insertion” refers to modification to the polypeptide by addition of one or more amino acids to the reference polypeptide. In some embodiments, the modification comprises insertions of one or more amino acids to the naturally occurring polypeptide as well as insertions of one or more amino acids to other modified polypeptides. Insertions can be in the internal portions of the polypeptide, or to the carboxy or amino terminus. Insertions as used herein include fusion proteins as is known in the art. The insertion can be a contiguous segment of amino acids or separated by one or more of the amino acids in the naturally occurring polypeptide. The term “insertion” is also used to refer to a DNA modification in which or more nucleotides or nucleotide base-pairs have been inserted, as compared to the corresponding reference, parental or “wild type” DNA.\n    “Different from” or “differs from” with respect to a designated reference sequence refers to difference of a given amino acid or polynucleotide sequence when aligned to the reference sequence. Generally, the differences can be determined when the two sequences are optimally aligned. Differences include insertions, deletions, or substitutions of amino acid residues in comparison to the reference sequence.\n    As used herein in the context of a polypeptide or polynucleotide, the phrase “derived from” a particular organism refers to a wild-type polynucleotide or polypeptide that originates in the organism and to mutant and variants thereof that either originate in the organism or are produced by human manipulation of the wild-type polynucleotide or polypeptide.\n    “Functional fragment” as used herein refers to a polypeptide that has an amino-terminal and/or carboxy-terminal deletion, but where the remaining amino acid sequence is identical to the corresponding positions in the sequence and that retains substantially all of the activity of the full-length polypeptide. Functional fragments can comprise up to 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, and 99% of the full-length polypeptide.\n    “Endogenous” polynucleotide, gene, promoter or polypeptide refers to any polynucleotide, gene, promoter or polypeptide that originates in a particular host cell. A polynucleotide, gene, promoter or polypeptide is not endogenous to a host cell if it has been removed from the host cell, subjected to laboratory manipulation, and then reintroduced into a host cell.\n    “Heterologous” polynucleotide, gene, promoter or polypeptide refers to any polynucleotide, gene, promoter or polypeptide that is introduced into a host cell that is not normally present in that cell, and includes any polynucleotide, gene, promoter or polypeptide that is removed from the host cell and then reintroduced into the host cell.\n    “Inactive” or “inactivated” in reference to a gene refers to a gene having at least one function that is impaired. Genes can be inactivated in a variety of ways known in the art, including but not limited to insertion of a mobile genetic element (e.g., a transposon); deletion of all or part of the gene, such that the gene product is not made, or is truncated and is non-functional; mutation of the gene such that the gene product is not made, or is truncated and is non-functional; deletion or mutation of one or more control elements that control expression of the gene such that the gene product is not made; and the like. In certain embodiments genes can be inactivated by methods other than genetic modification, for example, by gene silencing at the transcriptional level or at the post-transcriptional level using for example RNAi.\n    “Recombinant host cell” refers to a cell into which has been introduced a heterologous polynucleotide, gene, promoter, e.g., an expression vector, or to a cell having a heterologous polynucleotide or gene integrated into the genome.\n    “Naturally-occurring” or “wild-type” refers to the form found in nature. For example, a naturally occurring or wild-type polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence is a sequence present in an organism that can be isolated from a source in nature and which has not been intentionally modified by human manipulation. A wild-type organism refers to an organism that has not been intentionally modified by human manipulation.\n    “Codon optimized” refers to changes in the codons of the polynucleotide encoding a protein to those preferentially used in a particular organism such that the encoded protein is efficiently expressed in the organism of interest. Although the genetic code is degenerate in that most amino acids are represented by several codons, called “synonyms” or “synonymous” codons, it is well known that codon usage by particular organisms is nonrandom and biased towards particular codon triplets. This codon usage bias may be higher in reference to a given gene, genes of common function or ancestral origin, highly expressed proteins versus low copy number proteins, and the aggregate protein coding regions of an organism's genome. In some embodiments, the polynucleotides encoding enzymes may be codon optimized for optimal production from the host organism selected for expression.\n    “Preferred, optimal, high codon usage bias codons” refers interchangeably to codons that are used at higher frequency in the protein coding regions than other codons that code for the same amino acid. The preferred codons may be determined in relation to codon usage in a single gene, a set of genes of common function or origin, highly expressed genes, the codon frequency in the aggregate protein coding regions of the whole organism, codon frequency in the aggregate protein coding regions of related organisms, or combinations thereof. Codons whose frequency increases with the level of gene expression are typically optimal codons for expression. A variety of methods are known for determining the codon frequency (e.g., codon usage, relative synonymous codon usage) and codon preference in specific organisms, including multivariate analysis, for example, using cluster analysis or correspondence analysis, and the effective number of codons used in a gene (See GCG Codon Preference, Genetics Computer Group Wisconsin Package; CodonW, John Peden, University of Nottingham; McInerney, J. O, \n    1998, Bioinformatics 14:372-73; Stenico et al., 1994, Nucleic Acids Res. 222437-46; Wright, F., 1990, Gene 87:23-29). Codon usage tables are available for a growing list of organisms (see for example, Wada et al., 1992, Nucleic Acids Res. 20:2111-2118; Nakamura et al., 2000, Nucl. Acids Res. 28:292; Duret, et al., supra; Henaut and Danchin, “\n    Escherichia coliand \n    Salmonella,”1996, Neidhardt, et al. Eds., ASM Press, Washington D.C., p. 2047-2066), all of which are incorporated herein by reference. The data source for obtaining codon usage may rely on any available nucleotide sequence capable of coding for a protein. These data sets include nucleic acid sequences actually known to encode expressed proteins (e.g., complete protein coding sequences-CDS), expressed sequence tags (ESTs), or predicted coding regions of genomic sequences (see for example, Mount, D., Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis, Chapter 8, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 2001; Uberbacher, E. C., 1996, Methods Enzymol. 266:259-281; Tiwari et al., 1997, Comput. Appl. Biosci. 13:263-270), all of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n    “Expression” as used herein may include any step involved in the production of the FAR polypeptides including but not limited to transcription and translation.\n    “Control sequence” is defined herein to include all components, which are necessary or advantageous for the expression of a polypeptide of the present disclosure. Each control sequence may be native or foreign to the nucleic acid sequence encoding the polypeptide. Such control sequences include, but are not limited to, a leader, polyadenylation sequence, propeptide sequence, promoter, signal peptide sequence, and transcription terminator. At a minimum, the control sequences include a promoter, and transcriptional and translational stop signals. The control sequences may be provided with linkers for the purpose of introducing specific restriction sites facilitating ligation of the control sequences with the coding region of the nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide.\n    “Operably linked” and “operably associated” are defined herein as a configuration in which a control sequence is appropriately placed at a position relative to the coding sequence of the DNA sequence such that the control sequence directs the expression of a polynucleotide and/or polypeptide.\n    “Promoter sequence” is a nucleic acid sequence that is recognized by a host cell for expression of the coding region. The control sequence may comprise an appropriate promoter sequence. The promoter sequence contains transcriptional control sequences, which mediate the expression of the polypeptide. The promoter may be any nucleic acid sequence which shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice including mutant, truncated, and hybrid promoters, and may be obtained from genes encoding extracellular or intracellular polypeptides either endogenous or heterologous to the host cell.\n    As used herein the term “transformed” or “transformation” used in reference to a cell means a cell has a non-native nucleic acid sequence integrated into its genome or as a plasmid that is maintained through multiple generations.\n    It should be noted that the indefinite articles “a” and “an” and the definite article “the” are used in the present application to mean one or more unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Further, the term “or” is used in the present application to mean the disjunctive “or” and the conjunctive “and”.\n    FAR Enzymes Useful in the Methods of the Disclosure:\n    In one aspect the present disclosure provides FAR enzymes derived from or obtained from gammaproteobacteria (such as marine gammaproteobacteria) and/or functional fragments thereof having FAR activity.

In various embodiments, the one or more domains is identified by multiple sequence alignments using hidden Markov models (“HMMs”) to search large collections of protein families, for example, the Pfam collection available at http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/. See R. D. Finn et al. (2008) \n    Nucl. Acids Res. Database Issue 36:D281-D288.\n    In certain embodiments, the one or more protein domains by which FAR enzymes are identified belongs to a family of NAD binding domains found in the male sterility proteins of \n    arabidopsisand \n    drosophila, as well as in the fatty acyl reductase enzyme from the jojoba plant (JJFAR). See Aarts M G et al. (1997) \n    Plant J.12:615-623. This family of binding domains is designated “NAD_binding\n    —4” (PF07993; see http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/family?acc=PF07993). In various embodiments, the NAD_binding\n    —4 domain is found near the N-terminus of the putative FAR enzyme. In various embodiments, the one or more protein domains by which enzymes with FAR activity are identified belongs to a family of domains known as a “sterile” domain (PF03015; see http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/family?acc=PF03015), which are also found in the male sterility proteins of \n    Arabidopsisspecies and a number of other organisms. See Aarts M G et al. (1997) \n    Plant J.12:615-623. In particular embodiments, the sterile domain is found near the C-terminus of the putative FAR enzyme. In certain specific embodiments, a FAR enzyme for use in the methods described herein is identified by the presence of at least one NAD_binding\n    —4 domain near the N-terminus and the presence of at least one sterile domain near the C-terminus.\n    In certain embodiments, the NAD_binding\n    —4 domain of the putative FAR enzyme has an amino acid sequence that is at least 10%, such as at least 15%, such as at least 20%, such as at least 25%, such as at least 30%, such as at least 35%, such as at least 40%, such as at least 45%, such as at least 50%, such as at least 60%, such as at least 70%, such as at least 80%, such as at least 85%, such as at least 90% or more identical to the amino acid sequence of a known NAD_binding\n    —4 domain. See, e.g., Aarts M G et al. (1997) \n    Plant J.12:615-623. In various embodiments, the sterile domain of the putative FAR enzyme has an amino acid sequence that is at least 10%, such as at least 15%, such as at least 20%, such as at least 25%, such as at least 30%, such as at least 35%, such as at least 40%, such as at least 45%, such as at least 50% or more identical to the amino acid sequence of a known sterile domain. See id.\n    In some embodiments, the NAD_binding\n    —4 domain of the putative FAR enzyme has an amino acid sequence that is at least 10%, such as at least 15%, such as at least 20%, such as at least 25%, such as at least 30%, such as at least 35%, such as at least 40%, such as at least 45%, such as at least 50%, such as at least 60%, such as at least 70%, such as at least 80%, such as at least 85%, such as at least 90% or more identical to the amino acid sequence of one or more example polypeptides that form the definition of the NAD_binding\n    —4 Pfam domain (PF07993). In certain embodiments, the sterile domain of the putative FAR enzyme has an amino acid sequence that is at least 10%, such as at least 15%, such as at least 20%, such as at least 25%, such as at least 30%, such as at least 35%, such as at least 40%, such as at least 45%, such as at least 50% or more identical to the amino acid sequence of one or more example polypeptides that form the definition of the sterile Pfam domain (PF03015). In various embodiments, the NAD_binding\n    —4 domain or the sterile domain of the putative FAR enzyme is identified by an E-value of 1×10\n    −4or less, such as an E-value of 1×10\n    −5, such as an E-value of 1×10\n    −10, such as an E-value of 1×10\n    −15, such as an E-value of 1×10\n    −20, such as an E-value of 1×10\n    −25, such as an E-value of 1×10\n    −30or lower. As used herein, the term E-value (expectation value) is the number of hits that would be expected to have a score equal or better than a particular hit by chance alone. Accordingly, the E-value is a criterion by which the significance of a database search hit can be evaluated. See, e.g., http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/help; http://www.csb.yale.edu/userguides/seq/hmmer/docs/node5.html.\n    The FAR enzymes described herein have not previously been recognized as FAR enzymes because of the low homology of the FAR coding sequences to the sequences coding for proteins with known FAR activity, such as the FAR enzymes from \n    S. chinensis((FAR Sim); GenBank Accession no.

The FAR enzyme or the specific or functional fragment encoded by the polynucleotide construct may be endogenous or heterologous to the host microorganism.\n    In various aspects of the disclosure, the availability of a polypeptide sequence of a specific FAR enzyme provides a description of all polynucleotides capable of encoding the polypeptide of known sequence because of the known correspondence of particular codons and the amino acids they encode.

Nucleic acids “hybridize” when they associate, typically in solution. Nucleic acids hybridize due to a variety of well-characterized physico-chemical forces, such as hydrogen bonding, solvent exclusion, base stacking and the like. As used herein, the term “stringent hybridization wash conditions” in the context of nucleic acid hybridization experiments, such as Southern and Northern hybridizations, are sequence dependent, and are different under different environmental parameters. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen, 1993, “Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology-Hybridization with Nucleic Acid Probes,” Part I, Chapter 2 (Elsevier, New York), which is incorporated herein by reference. For polynucleotides of at least 100 nucleotides in length, low to very high stringency conditions are defined as follows: prehybridization and hybridization at 42° C. in 5×SSPE, 0.3% SDS, 200 μg/ml sheared and denatured salmon sperm DNA, and either 25% formamide for low stringencies, 35% formamide for medium and medium-high stringencies, or 50% formamide for high and very high stringencies, following standard Southern blotting procedures. For polynucleotides of at least 100 nucleotides in length, the carrier material is finally washed three times each for 15 minutes using 2×SSC, 0.2% SDS at least at 50° C. (low stringency), at least at 55° C. (medium stringency), at least at 60° C. (medium-high stringency), at least at 65° C. (high stringency), and at least at 70° C. (very high stringency).\n    The polynucleotides encoding FAR enzymes for expression in heterologous recombinant host cells as described herein are operably linked to a promoter, and optionally, to other control sequences. Suitable promoters include constitutive promoters, regulated promoters, and inducible promoters. Appropriate promoter sequences can be obtained from genes encoding extracellular or intracellular polypeptides which are either endogenous or heterologous to the host cell. Methods for the isolation, identification and manipulation of promoters of varying strengths are available in or readily adapted from the art. See e.g., Nevoigt et al. (2006) \n    Appl. Environ. Microbiol.72:5266-5273, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n    In certain embodiments, the DNA constructs, vectors and polynucleotides are suitable for expression of a heterologous FAR enzyme in bacteria. For bacterial host cells, suitable promoters for directing transcription of the nucleic acid constructs of the present disclosure, include the promoters obtained from the \n    E. colilac operon, \n    Streptomyces coelicoloragarase gene (dagA), \n    Bacillus subtilislevansucrase gene (sacB), \n    Bacillus licheniformisalpha-amylase gene (amyL), \n    Bacillus stearothermophilusmaltogenic amylase gene (amyM), \n    Bacillus amyloliquefaciensalpha-amylase gene (amyQ), \n    Bacillus licheniformis penicillinasegene (penP), \n    Bacillus subtilisxylA and xylB genes, \n    Bacillus megateriumpromoters, and prokaryotic beta-lactamase gene (Villa-Kamaroff et al., \n    Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA75: 3727-3731 (1978)), as well as the tac promoter (DeBoer et al., \n    Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA80: 21-25 (1993)). Additional promoters include trp promoter, phage lambda PL, T7 promoter, promoters found at PromEC (http://margalit.huji.ac.il/promec/index.html) and the like. Promoters suitable for use in the present disclosure are described in “Useful proteins from recombinant bacteria” in \n    Scientific American242:74-94 (1980); and in Sambrook et al (2001) \n    Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,3\n    rded., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York.\n    In various embodiments, the DNA constructs, vectors and polynucleotides are suitable for expression of a heterologous FAR enzyme in yeast. In certain embodiments, the DNA constructs, vectors and polynucleotides are suitable for expression of a heterologous FAR enzyme in oleaginous yeast. In various embodiments, the DNA constructs, vectors and polynucleotides are suitable for expression of a heterologous FAR enzyme in the oleaginous yeast \n    Y. lipolytica. In certain embodiments, the DNA constructs, vectors and polynucleotides are suitable for expression of a heterologous FAR enzyme in \n    S. cerevisiae. For yeast host cells, suitable promoters for directing transcription of the nucleic acid constructs of the present disclosure are known to the skilled artisan and include, but are not limited to, an enolase (ENO-1_gene) promoter, a galactokinase (GAL1) promoter, an alcohol dehyrogenase/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ADH2/GAP) promoter, a translation elongation factor EF-1 alpha (TEF1) promoter as well as those described by Romanos et al. (1992) \n    Yeast8:423-488. In other embodiments, promoters include the TEF1 promoter and an RPS7 promoter.\n    For filamentous fungal host cells, suitable promoters for directing the transcription of the nucleic acid constructs of the present disclosure include promoters obtained from the genes for \n    Aspergillus oryzaeTAKA amylase, \n    Rhizomucor mieheiaspartic proteinase, \n    Aspergillus nigerneutral alpha-amylase, \n    Aspergillus nigeracid stable alpha-amylase, \n    Aspergillus nigeror \n    Aspergillus awamoriglucoamylase (glaA), \n    Rhizomucor mieheilipase, \n    Aspergillus oryzaealkaline protease, \n    Aspergillus oryzaetriose phosphate isomerase, \n    Aspergillus nidulans acetamidase, and \n    Fusarium oxysporumtrypsin-like protease (WO 96/00787), as well as the NA2-tpi promoter (a hybrid of the promoters from the genes for \n    Aspergillus nigerneutral alpha-amylase and \n    Aspergillus oryzaetriose phosphate isomerase), and mutant, truncated, and hybrid promoters thereof. Examples of suitable promoters useful for directing the transcription of the nucleotide constructs of the present invention in a filamentous fungal host cell are promoters such as cbh1, cbh2, egl1, egl2, pepA, hfb1, hfb2, xyn1, amy, and glaA (Nunberg et al., Mol. Cell. Biol., 4:2306-2315 (1984), Boel et al., EMBO J. 3:1581-1585 ((1984) and EPA 137280).\n    In various embodiments, an expression vector optionally contains a ribosome binding site (RBS) for translation initiation, and a transcription terminator, such as PinII. The vector also optionally includes appropriate sequences for amplifying expression, e.g., an enhancer.\n    In various embodiments, the polynucleotides useful for expressing heterologous FAR enzymes in recombinant host cells are operably linked to other control sequences, including but not limited to, a transcription terminator sequence, a signal sequence that when translated directs the expressed polypeptide into the secretory pathway of the recombinant host cell, and a polyadenylation sequence (eukaryotes). The choice of appropriate control sequences for use in the polynucleotide constructs of the present disclosure is within the skill in the art and in various embodiments is dependent on the recombinant host cell used and the desired method of recovering the fatty alcohol compositions produced.\n    The instant disclosure further relates to recombinant expression vectors for use in the methods described herein. A recombinant expression vector can be any vector, e.g., a plasmid or a virus, which can be manipulated by recombinant DNA techniques to facilitate expression of a heterologous FAR enzyme in a recombinant host cell. In certain embodiments, the expression vectors is integrated into the chromosome of the recombinant host cell and comprises one or more heterologous genes operably linked to one or more control sequences useful for production of a FAR enzyme. In other embodiments, the expression vector is an extra chromosomal replicative DNA molecule, e.g., a linear or closed circular plasmid, that is found either in low copy number (e.g., from about 1 to about 10 copies per genome equivalent) or in high copy number (e.g., more than about 10 copies per genome equivalent). In various embodiments, the expression vector includes a selectable marker, such as a gene that confers antibiotic resistance (e.g., ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol or tetracycline resistance) to the recombinant host organism that comprises the vector.\n    Expression vectors which, in certain embodiments, are useful for expressing FAR enzymes as disclosed herein are commercially available, e.g., from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals, St. Louis Mo. and Stratagene, LaJolla Calif. In some embodiments, examples of suitable expression vectors are plasmids which are derived from pBR322 (Gibco BRL), pUC (Gibco BRL), pREP4, pCEP4 (Invitrogen) or pPoly (Lathe et al., 1987, \n    Gene57:193-201).\n    In certain embodiments, the present disclosure provides a plasmid for expression of heterologous genes in \n    E. coli. Expression vector pCK110900, which comprises a P15A origin of replication (P15A ori), lac a CAP binding site, a lac promoter, a T7 ribosomal binding site (T7g10 RBS) and a chloramphenicol resistance gene (camR). This expression vector is depicted in FIG. 3 of U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006/0195947, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n    In particular embodiments, the present disclosure provides an autonomous replicating plasmid for expression of heterologous genes in \n    Yarrowia, and particularly in \n    Y. lipolytica. This plasmid vector (pCEN411; \n    FIG. 1) was engineered with cassettes for expression of a gene encoding resistance to hygromycin (HygB\n    R) and for expression of a FAR gene optimized for \n    Y. lipolytica. In these embodiments, expression of each gene is independently regulated by a strong, constitutive promoter isolated from \n    Y. lipolytica: pTEF1 for FAR expression and pRPS7 for HygB\n    Rexpression. When this plasmid was transformed into \n    Y. lipolytica, it conferred resistance to hygromycin and directed expression of FAR. This plasmid can be further modified for expression of heterologous genes useful for fatty alcohol production in yeast, inter alia, \n    Y. lipolytica.\n    In some embodiments, expression vectors as described herein are adapted for over expression of genes encoding enzymes other than FAR that are directly involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. In particular embodiments, the over expressed gene encodes a protein selected from a fatty acid synthase (FAS), an acyl-ACP thioesterase (TE), a fatty acyl-CoA synthase (FACS) and an acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). In some embodiments, the expression vector encoding the FAR enzyme and the expression vector encoding a second enzyme (e.g., an FAS, TE, FACS or ACC) are separate nucleic acids.

In some embodiments, the FAR enzyme is endogenous to the microorganism. In other embodiments, the FAR enzyme is heterologous to the microorganism.\n    In certain embodiments, the recombinant microorganism over expresses a gene that encodes one or more proteins other than a FAR enzyme. In various embodiments, the one or more over expressed protein increases the rate at which the recombinant cell produces the acyl-thioester FAR substrate, e.g., the compound of formula (I) shown above. In some embodiments, the one or more over expressed genes encodes a protein directly involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. In particular embodiments, the one or more over expressed genes encode a protein selected from a fatty acid synthase (FAS), an acyl-ACP thioesterase (TE), a fatty acyl-CoA synthase (FACS) and an acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). In some embodiments, the over expressed gene is endogenous to the microorganism. In other embodiments, the over expressed gene is heterologous to the microorganism.\n    “Fatty acid synthase (FAS)” refers to an enzyme or enzyme complex that catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA units to fatty acyl-ACP as set forth in Scheme II, and reference is also made to \n    FIG. 13:\n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    wherein R has the same meaning as set forth above in the definitions. In certain embodiments, the FAS is composed of more than one distinct enzymatic activity. In various embodiments, the distinct enzymatic activities reside in separate polypeptides. In some embodiments, the separate polypeptides form one or more protein complexes.\n    The term “acyl-ACP thioesterase (TE)” refers to an enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of acyl-ACP to form a fatty acid, as shown in Scheme III and reference is also made to \n    FIG. 13, wherein R has the same meaning as set forth above:\n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    “FACS” refers to an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of the covalent complex between the acyl portion of the fatty acid and Coenzyme A as shown below in Scheme IV, wherein R has the same meaning as set forth above:\n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    The term “acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)” refers to an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA as shown below in Scheme V:\n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    Synthesis of Fatty Alcohols by an Acyl-CoA Independent Pathway:\n    \n    FIG. 13illustrates the biosynthetic pathways for fatty alcohol formation. FAR enzymes can act directly on fatty acyl-CoA substrates to form fatty alcohols. However, as described in more detail herein, the present inventors have discovered that the amount of fatty alcohols produced in certain microorganisms comprising a gene encoding a FAR encompassed by the invention and lacking a functional endogenous fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (FACS) is comparable to the amount of fatty alcohol produced by the microorganism that has a functional endogenous FACS gene. Referring to \n    FIG. 13, a recombinant microorganism that lacks a functional FACS gene does not catalyze the formation of fatty acyl-CoA substrates from fatty acids. Accordingly, the present inventors have posited that FAR enzymes (such as marine gammaproteobacterium FAR enzymes) as described herein catalyze the biosynthesis of fatty alcohols from fatty acyl-ACP substrates via an acyl-CoA independent pathway in lieu of, or in addition to, using fatty acyl-CoA substrates.\n    In certain embodiments, the present disclosure relates to the use of a FAR enzyme as described herein, e.g., a FAR enzyme from a marine bacterium, for producing a fatty alcohol composition. The discovery that FAR enzymes described herein utilized fatty acyl-ACP substrates instead of or in addition to, fatty acyl-CoA substrates provided for more efficient methods for producing fatty alcohol. In hosts, such as \n    E. coliwhich convert fatty acyl-ACP to fatty acyl-CoA via free fatty acids, the formation of fatty acyl-CoA complexes requires ATP. Thus, in the acyl-CoA independent pathway because production of fatty alcohols by FAR enzymes (e.g., marine bacterial FAR enzymes) from fatty acyl-ACP as described herein bypasses this step, less energy is used to form the fatty alcohol compositions. The present inventors' discovery of the mechanism of action of FARs as encompassed by the invention further allows for the production of fatty alcohols in recombinant cells that do not produce fatty acyl-CoA substrates or that produce low levels of the acyl-CoA substrates compared to wild-type or parent microorganisms. Accordingly fatty alcohols can be produced by a recombinant microorganism that lacks a functional endogenous enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acyl-CoA substrates. Thus in some aspects, fatty alcohols can be produced by a recombinant microorganism that express a gene encoding a FAR enzyme described herein and that lacks a gene encoding a fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (FACS) and/or a gene encoding a fatty acyl-ACP thioesterase (TE).\n    Thus, in some embodiments, the present disclosure provides for a mechanism of action for the production of fatty alcohols by an acyl-CoA independent pathway, wherein certain FAR enzymes encompassed by the invention may act on fatty acyl-ACP substrates in lieu of, or in addition to, acting on fatty acyl-CoA substrates, to produce fatty alcohols. In some embodiments of this aspect, the FAR enzymes from as encompassed by the invention herein including but not limited to FAR enzymes from \n    Marinobacterspecies, such as \n    Marinobacterspecies \n    algicola(DG893) and \n    Marinobacter aquaeolei, and \n    Oceanobacterspecies strain RED65 or functional fragments thereof can produce levels of fatty alcohols in the absence of, or in the presence of low levels of fatty acyl-CoA substrates, which were thought to be the main substrates of FAR enzymes that are comparable to the levels of fatty alcohols produced in the presence of normal levels of fatty acyl-CoA substrates. In further embodiments of this aspect, the invention relates to a recombinant host cell comprising a nucleic acid encoding a FAR enzyme according to the invention and an inactivated or silenced endogenous fatty acyl-ACP thioesterase gene, an inactivated or silenced endogenous fatty acyl-CoA synthetase gene or both. In some embodiments, the recombinant microorganisms provided herein above do not produce detectable levels of fatty acyl-CoA substrates and in other embodiments the recombinant microorganisms produce reduced levels of fatty acyl-CoA substrates as compared to wild-type cells.\n    In one preferred embodiment, fatty alcohols are produced by an acyl-CoA independent pathway comprising culturing a recombinant bacterial cells under suitable culture conditions, wherein the recombinant bacterial cell comprises a gene encoding a heterologous FAR polypeptide encompassed by the invention and wherein the recombinant bacterial cell comprises one or more endogenous polynucleotides that have been inactivated or silenced selected from a fadD gene, which codes for an acyl-CoA synthetase protein, a fadK gene, which codes for an endogenous short-chain acyl-CoA synthetase or both; allowing expression of the gene encoding the heterologous FAR enzyme and producing fatty alcohols by the conversion of fatty acyl-ACP substrates.\n    In certain embodiments, the recombinant host cell is an \n    E. colicell. In some embodiments of this aspect, the FAR enzymes are derived from \n    Marinobacter algicola(DG893), \n    Marinobacter aquaeolei, and \n    Oceanobacterspecies strain RED65 or functional fragments thereof. In certain embodiments, the FAR enzyme for use in the methods disclosed herein has an amino acid that has an amino acid sequence that is at least about 75% identical, at least about 80% identical, such as at least about 85% identical, such as at least about 90% identical, such as at least about 91%, such as at least about 92%, such as at least about 93%, such as at least about 94%, such as at least about 95%, such as at least about 96%, such as at least about 97%, such as at least about 98%, such as at least about 99% identical to the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 14, or functional fragments thereof.\n    Methods of Producing Fatty Alcohols and Compositions of Fatty Alcohols:\n    In various aspects of the present disclosure, fatty alcohols can be produced in cell-free systems. In certain embodiments, a FAR enzyme as described herein is provided with a substrate and all necessary cofactors to carry out the production of a fatty alcohol from a fatty acyl-thioesterase substrate. In certain aspects, fatty alcohols can be produced by recombinant microorganisms that express a heterologous FAR enzyme as described herein. In particular aspects, fatty alcohols can be produced by recombinant microorganisms that express a heterologous FAR enzyme and one or more proteins other than a FAR enzyme. In some embodiments, the fatty alcohols produced by the recombinant microorganisms are secreted into the nutrient medium. In other embodiments, the fatty alcohols produced by the recombinant microorganisms are extracted from the microorganisms.\n    In certain embodiments, the present disclosure relates to the use of a FAR enzyme as described herein, e.g., a FAR enzyme from a marine gamma proteobacterium, for producing a fatty alcohol composition in a cell-free system. In some embodiments, the FAR enzyme is provided with a substrate, e.g., a fatty acyl-thioester of the formula (I) and NAD(P)H under suitable conditions of temperature, pH, and ionic strength and time sufficient for the production of a fatty alcohol composition. In some embodiments, the FAR enzyme is provided with a composition of a fatty acid, Coenzyme A, ATP, NAD(P)H, and a fatty acyl-CoA synthase under suitable conditions of temperature, pH and ionic strength and time sufficient for production of the fatty acyl-CoA substrate of the FAR enzyme by the fatty acyl-CoA synthase and for production of a fatty alcohol composition from the fatty acyl-CoA substrate.\n    In certain embodiments of the present disclosure, a fatty alcohol composition is produced by a recombinant host cell comprising a heterologous gene encoding a FAR enzyme as described above, which is cultured in an aqueous nutrient medium comprising an assimilable source of carbon under conditions suitable for production of a fatty alcohol composition. In some embodiments, the fatty alcohol is produced by a recombinant host cell comprising a heterologous gene encoding a FAR enzyme as described above and the recombinant host cell comprises an inactivated or silenced gene selected from an acyl-ACP thioesterase and a fatty acyl-CoA synthetase.\n    In various embodiments, the recombinant host cell is a bacterium. In particular embodiments, the bacterium is \n    E. coli. In other embodiments, the recombinant host cell is a yeast. In particular embodiments, the yeast is \n    S. cerevisiae. In certain embodiments, the yeast is an oleaginous yeast. In certain particular embodiments, the oleaginous yeast is \n    Y. lipolytica.\n    In various embodiments, a fatty alcohol composition is produced by a recombinant host cell comprising a heterologous gene encoding a FAR enzyme from a marine bacterium and which over expresses a gene encoding one or more proteins that increases the rate at which the recombinant host cell produces the acyl-thioester FAR substrate, e.g., the compound of formula (I) above. In some embodiments, the one or more over expressed genes encode a protein directly involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. In particular embodiments, the one or more over expressed genes encode a protein selected from a fatty acid synthase (FAS), an acyl-ACP thioesterase (TE), a fatty acyl-CoA synthase (FACS) and an acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC).\n    “Culturing” or “cultivation” refers to growing a population of microbial cells under suitable conditions in a liquid or solid medium. In particular embodiments, culturing refers to the fermentative bioconversion of a substrate to an end-product. Culturing media are well known and individual components of such culture media are available from commercial sources, e.g., under the Difco™ and BBL™ trademarks. In one non-limiting example, the aqueous nutrient medium is a “rich medium” comprising complex sources of nitrogen, salts, and carbon, such as YP medium, comprising 10 g/L of peptone and 10 g/L yeast extract of such a medium.\n    In other non-limiting embodiments, the aqueous nutrient medium comprises a mixture of Yeast Nitrogen Base (Difco) supplemented with an appropriate mixture of amino acids, e.g. SC medium. In particular aspects of this embodiment, the amino acid mixture lacks one or more amino acids, thereby imposing selective pressure for maintenance of an expression vector within the recombinant host cell.\n    Fermentation of the recombinant host cell comprising a heterologous FAR gene for production of fatty alcohols is carried out under suitable conditions and for a time sufficient for production of fatty alcohols. Conditions for the culture and production of cells, including bacterial and yeast cells, are readily available. Cell culture media in general are set forth in Atlas and Parks (eds.) \n    The Handbook of Microbiological Media(1993) CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla., which is incorporated herein by reference. Additional information for cell culture is found in available commercial literature such as the \n    Life Science Research Cell Culture Catalogue(1998) from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc (St Louis, Mo.) (“Sigma-LSRCCC”) and, for example, \n    The Plant Culture Catalogueand supplement (1997) also from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc (St Louis, Mo.) (“Sigma-PCCS”), all of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n    In some embodiments, cells expressing the heterologous FAR genes as described herein are grown under batch or continuous fermentations conditions. Classical batch fermentation is a closed system, wherein the compositions of the medium is set at the beginning of the fermentation and is not subject to artificial alternations during the fermentation. A variation of the batch system is a fed-batch fermentation which also finds use in the present invention. In this variation, the substrate is added in increments as the fermentation progresses. Fed-batch systems are useful when catabolite repression is likely to inhibit the metabolism of the cells and where it is desirable to have limited amounts of substrate in the medium. Batch and fed-batch fermentations are common and well known in the art. Continuous fermentation is an open system where a defined fermentation medium is added continuously to a bioreactor and an equal amount of conditioned medium is removed simultaneously for processing. Continuous fermentation generally maintains the cultures at a constant high density where cells are primarily in log phase growth. Continuous fermentation systems strive to maintain steady state growth conditions. Methods for modulating nutrients and growth factors for continuous fermentation processes as well as techniques for maximizing the rate of product formation are well known in the art of industrial microbiology.\n    In some embodiments, fermentations are carried out a temperature within the range of from about 10° C. to about 60° C., from about 15° C. to about 50° C., from about 20° C. to about 45° C., and from about 25° C. to about 40° C. In a particular aspect, the fermentation is carried out at a temperature of from about 28° C. and also from about 30° C. In other embodiments, the fermentation is carried out for a period of time within the range of from about 8 hours to 240 hours, from about 8 hours to about 168 hours, from about 16 hours to about 144 hours, from about 16 hours to about 120 hours, or from about 24 hours to about 72 hours. It will be understood that, in certain embodiments where thermostable host cells are used, fermentations may be carried out at higher temperatures. In other embodiments, the fermentation will be carried out at a pH in the range of 4 to 8, in the range of 4.5 to 7.5, in the range of 5 to 7, and also in the range of 5.5 to 6.5.\n    Carbon sources useful in the aqueous fermentation medium or broth of the disclosed process in which the recombinant microorganisms are grown are those assimilable by the recombinant host strain. Assimilable carbon sources are available in many forms and include renewable carbon sources and the cellulosic and starch feedstock substrates obtained there from. Such examples include for example monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, succinate, acetate and mixtures thereof. Further carbon sources include, without limitation, glucose, galactose, sucrose, xylose, fructose, glycerol, arabinose, mannose, raffinose, lactose, maltose, and mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the term “fermentable sugars” is used interchangeably with the term “assimilable carbon source”. In one aspect, fermentation is carried out with a mixture of glucose and galactose as the assimilable carbon source. In another aspect, fermentation is carried out with glucose alone to accumulate biomass, after which the glucose is substantially removed and replaced with an inducer, e.g., galactose for induction of expression of one or more heterologous genes involved in fatty alcohol production. In still another aspect, fermentation is carried out with an assimilable carbon source that does not mediate glucose repression, e.g., raffinose, to accumulate biomass, after which the inducer, e.g., galactose, is added to induce expression of one or more heterologous genes involved in fatty alcohol production. In some preferred embodiments, the assimilable carbon source is from cellulosic and starch feedstock derived from but not limited to, wood, wood pulp, paper pulp, grain, corn stover, corn fiber, rice, paper and pulp processing waste, woody or herbaceous plants, fruit or vegetable pulp, distillers grain, grasses, rice hulls, wheat straw, cotton, hemp, flax, sisal, corn cobs, sugar cane bagasse, switch grass and mixtures thereof.\n    In various embodiments, the present disclosure relates to methods of producing a fatty alcohol composition comprising culturing a recombinant host cell comprising a gene expressing a heterologous FAR enzyme in an aqueous nutrient medium comprising an assimilable source of carbon under conditions in which a fatty alcohol composition of produced, and isolating the fatty alcohols.\n    In certain embodiments of the disclosed processes, at least 10%, such as at least 20%, such as at least 25%, such as at least 30%, such as at least 40%, such as at least 50%, such as at least 60%, such as at least 70%, such as at least 80%, such as at least 90% of the fatty alcohols produced by the methods described herein are secreted into the culture medium. In particular embodiments, when the recombinant microorganism is \n    E. coli, Yarrowia(e.g., \n    Y. lipolytica) or \n    Saccharomyces(e.g., \n    S. cerevisiae) at least 25% and also at least 50% of the fatty alcohols produced by the methods encompassed by the invention will be secreted into the culture medium.\n    In various embodiments, fatty alcohols produced by the methods of the invention are further recovered or isolated. Recovery or isolating the produced fatty alcohols refers to substantially separating the fatty alcohols from other components of the culture medium or fermentation process. Recovery or isolation may be by solvent extraction of the aqueous nutrient medium with a suitable water immiscible solvent. Extraction may occur simultaneously with fatty alcohol production and extraction may be continuous. Phase separation followed by solvent removal provides the fatty alcohol which may then be further purified and fractionated using methods and equipment known in the art. In other aspects of the disclosure, the secreted fatty alcohols coalesce to form a water immiscible phase that can be directly separated from the aqueous nutrient medium either during the fermentation or after its completion.\n    In some embodiments, less than 60%, less than about 50%, such as less than about 40%, such as less than about 30%, such as less than about 20%, such as less than about 10% of the fatty alcohols produced by the methods described herein are secreted from the recombinant host cells. In some embodiments, at least about 30%, such as at least about 40%, such as at least about 45%, such as at least about 50%, such as at least about 60%, such as at least about 65%, such as at least about than 70%, such as at least about 75%, such as a least about 80%, such as at least about 85%, such as at least about 90% of the fatty alcohols produced by the methods described herein are secreted from the recombinant host cells. In certain embodiments, fatty alcohols are isolated by separating the cells from the aqueous nutrient medium, for example by centrifugation, resuspension and extraction of the fatty alcohols from the recombinant host cells using an organic solvent or solvent mixture. Suitable protocols for recovering fatty alcohols from recombinant host cells and/or culture medium are known to the skilled artisan. In some embodiments, fatty alcohols may be recovered by first lysing the cells to release the fatty alcohols and then extracting the fatty alcohol from the lysate using conventional means.

In Vivo Activity of FARs in Recombinant \n    E. coliUsing Shake Flasks\n    Recombinant \n    E. colihost strains comprising a plasmid containing a heterologous gene encoding either the \n    B. mori, M. algicolaDG893, \n    M. aquaeoleior \n    Oceanobactersp. RED65 fatty acyl-CoA reductase, were grown in Luria Bertani Broth (LB) medium supplemented with 1% glucose and 30 μg/mL chloramphenicol (CAM), for approximately 16-18 hours (overnight) at 30° C., 200 rpm. A 5% inoculum was used to initiate fresh 50 mL 2xYT Broth culture supplemented with 30 μg/mL CAM and 0-0.4% glucose. The culture was incubated in a shaker for 2.5 hours at 30° C. and 200 rpm to an OD\n    600of about 0.6 to about 0.8, at which point expression of the heterologous FAR was induced with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) (1 mM final concentration). Incubation was continued for about 16 hours (overnight) under the same conditions. Cells were collected by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 6000 rpm in F15B-8×50C rotor. The cell pellets were resuspended in 0.5 mL of 6.7% Na\n    2SO\n    4and then extracted with 1 mL of isopropanol:methyl t-butyl ether (4/6 ratio) for 2 hrs. The extract was centrifuged and analyzed either directly by GC-FID or GC-MS or derivatized with BSTFA before analysis. For derivatization, a 400 μL sample was taken off the top organic layer, evaporated under a nitrogen stream and the residue was derivatized with 100 μL N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide) (BSTFA) at 37° C. for 1 hour, and then diluted with 100 μL of heptanes before analysis by GC-FID or GC-MS. 0.5 mL of the culture medium (after removal of cells by centrifugation) was also extracted with 1 mL methyl t-butyl ether for 1 hr. The organic phase was either analyzed directly by GC-FID or GC-MS or derivatized with BSTFA as described above before analysis. In addition, 0.5 mL of the cell culture (before removal of cells by centrifugation) was directly extracted with 1 mL of isopropanol:hexane (4:6 ratio) for 2 hrs. The organic phase was either analyzed directly by GC-FID or GC-MS or derivatized with BSTFA as described above before analysis.\n    A 1 μL sample was analyzed by GC-FID with the split ratio 1:10 using the following conditions: GC-6890N from Agilent Technologies equipped with FID detector and HP-5 column (length 30 m, I.D. 0.32 mm, film 0.25 μm). GC method: start at 100° C., increase the temperature with a rate of 25° C./min to 246° C. and hold for 1.96 min. Total run time, 7.8 min. Under the above GC conditions the approximate retention times (min) of produced fatty alcohols and acids are as follows: 5.08, C14:0-OH; 5.40; C14:0-OOH; 5.74, C16:1-OH, 5.93; C16:0-OH, 6.11; C16:0-OOMe (internal standard); 6.16, C16:1-OOH, 6.29; C16:0-OOH, 6.80; C18:1-OH, 6.90; C18:0-OH, 7.3; C18:0- and C18:1-OOH.

In Vivo Activity of FARs in Recombinant \n    E. coliUsing Fermentors\n    In an aerated, agitated stirred tank fermentor, 1.0 L of growth medium containing 11.28 g/L 5×M9 minimal salts (BD, Franklin Lakes, N.J.); 2 g/L yeast extract (BD, Franklin Lakes, N.J.); 3 g/L glucose (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.); 2 mM MgSO\n    4(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.); 0.1 mM CaCl\n    2(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.); and 30 μg/ml chloroamphenicol (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) was brought to a temperature of 30° C. The fermentor was inoculated with a late exponential culture of \n    E. coliBW25113 ΔfadE equipped with plasmid containing \n    M. algicolaDG893 (as described in Example 2b) to a starting optical density at 600 nm (OD\n    600) of 0.8 to 1.0. The inoculum was grown in a shake flask containing TB (BD, Franklin Lakes, N.J.); 0.4% glycerol (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.), and 30 μg/ml chloroamphenicol (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) at 30° C. and 250 rpm until OD600 reached around 5.0. The fermentor was agitated at 400-1000 rpm and air supplied at 1.0 L/min to maintain a minimum dissolved oxygen level of 30% of saturation. The pH of the culture was controlled at 7.0 initially by addition of mixture of 14% v/v ammonium hydroxide and 10% w/v sodium hydroxide. The base for pH control was switched to 20% w/v sodium hydroxide when ammonium concentration in the broth reached 1.5-2.0 g/L. After the culture reached an OD\n    600of 5.0, the expression of \n    M. algicolaDG893 FAR was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) (Sigma Chemical Corp., St. Louis, Mo.) to a final concentration of 1 mM. Growth of the culture and production of fatty alcohol were maintained by addition of a feed solution containing 500 g/L glucose. Addition of glucose (6 g/L per pulse) was triggered whenever pH reached 7.2. Culture was then grown for another 135-140 hours at 30° C. 3 g/L yeast extract shots were added at 55 and 95 hours. Samples were taken at different time points for analysis. Extraction and quantification of fatty alcohols were performed as described in Example 2b. Under the conditions tested, total production and secretion of fatty alcohols were estimated to be ˜12-15 and 9-13 g/L, respectively.\n    Example 3\n    Expression and Activity of FAR Enzymes in Various \n    E. coliStrains\n    a. Construction of Vectors to Express FARs in Various \n    E. coliStrains\n    The FAR genes were cloned into the vector pCK110900-I (shown in FIG. 3 of U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006/0195947) under the control of a lac promoter as described above. The resulting plasmids were introduced into \n    E. coliBW25113 parent and knock-out strains (ΔfadE and ΔfadD, ΔfadK) derived from BW25113 (Baba et al., Molecular Systems Biology (2006) doi:10.1038/msb4100050, Article No. 2006.0008; Morgan-Kiss et al., J. Biol. Chem. (2004), 279: 37324-37333 and Campbell, et al., Molecular Microbiology (2003), 47(3): 793-805) by routine transformation methods.\n    b. In Vivo Activity of FARs in Various Recombinant \n    E. coliStrains Using Shake Flasks\n    Recombinant \n    E. coliBW25113 strains (parent, ΔfadE, ΔfadD, and ΔfadK knock-outs) comprising a plasmid containing a heterologous gene encoding either \n    M. algicolaDG893 or \n    Oceanobactersp. RED65 fatty acyl reductase (FAR), were grown on Luria Bertani (LB) medium supplements with 1% glucose and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol (CAM) for approximately 16-18 hours (overnight) at 30° C., 200 rpm. A 5% inoculums was used to initiate fresh 50 mL LB culture supplemented with 30 μg/mL CAM. The culture was incubated for 2.5 hrs at 30° C. and 200 rpm to an OD600 of 0.6-0.8, at which point expression of the heterologous FAR gene was induced with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) (1 mM final concentration). Incubation was continued for about 24 hours under the same conditions. Extraction and quantitation of fatty alcohols were performed as described in Example 2b except the use of following GC method: start at 80° C. for 3 mins, increase the temperature at a rate of 50° C./min to 200° C., then increase the temperature at a rate of 10° C./min to 270° C. and finally, increase at 20° C./min to 300° C. and hold for 5 min (total rum time 18.8 min). Under the above GC conditions the approximate retention times (mins) of produced fatty alcohols and acids were as follows: 6.90, C12:0-OH; 8.04, C14:0-OH; 8.42, d27-C14:0-OOH (internal standard); 8.53, C14:0-OOH; 9.11, C16:1-OH; 9.23, C16:0-OH; 9.68, C16:1-OOH, 9.80; C16:0-OOH; 10; 46, C18:1-OH; 10.57, C18:0-OH; 11.10, C18:1-OOH, and 11.25, C18:0-OOH. Identification of individual fatty alcohol was done by comparison to commercial standards (Sigma Chemical Company, St Louis, Mo. 63103). Under the conditions tested, expression of the \n    M. algicolaDG893 and \n    Oceanobactersp. RED65 FAR in \n    E. coliBW25113 and the corresponding ΔfadD, ΔfadE and ΔfadK strains resulted in production of fatty alcohols (Tables 3a and 3b). Typical shake flask titer for \n    E. coliBW25113 expressing \n    M. algicolaDG893 and \n    Oceanobactersp. RED65 FARs was 100-200 mg/L. Since both FARs are able to produce significant amounts of fatty alcohols in the absence of the fadD and fadK acyl-CoA synthetases in \n    E. coli, these FARs are able to reduce non acyl-CoA substrates.\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n              \n                TABLE 3A\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n              \n              \n                Fatty alcohol profile exhibited by recombinant \n                E.colihost cells expressing a\n              \n              \n                heterologous \n                M.\n                algicolaFAR gene\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                \n                Relative production\n              \n              \n                \n                \n                of fatty\n              \n              \n                Recombinant \n                E.colicells\n                Deleted protein\n                alcohols\n                a\n              \n              \n                \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            \n            \n            \n              \n                BW25113\n                —\n                1.0\n              \n              \n                BW25113 ΔfadE\n                Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase\n                1.0\n              \n              \n                BW25113 ΔfadD\n                Acyl-CoA synthetase\n                0.78\n              \n              \n                BW25113 ΔfadKlydiD\n                Short chain acyl-CoA\n                0.64\n                b\n              \n              \n                \n                synthetase, anaerobic\n              \n              \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                aFatty alcohols include: 15-17% C14:0 (1-tetradeconal), approximately 38% C16:1 (cis Δ\n                9-1-hexadeconal), 23-24% C16:0 (1-hexacecanol), 21-22% C18:1 (cis Δ\n                11-1-octadeconal), 0-1% C18:0 (1-octadecanol).\n              \n              \n                \n                bData obtained from evaluation of strains in microtiter plates.\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n            \n              TABLE 3B\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              Fatty alcohol profile exhibited by recombinant \n              E.colihost cells expressing a\n            \n            \n              heterologous Oceanobacter sp.

Expression of each cassette was independently regulated by a strong, constitutive promoter isolated from \n    Y. lipolytica: pTEF1 for Ble(R) expression and pRPS7 for HygB(R) expression. Plasmid pCEN354 was used to assemble \n    Y. lipolyticaexpression plasmids. Using “restriction free cloning” methodology, the FAR gene was inserted into pCEN354 to provided plasmid pCEN411 (\n    FIG. 1). In pCEN411, heterologous gene expression is under control of the constitutive TEF1 promoter. The HygB\n    Rgene allows for selection in media containing hygromycin.

Extraction and identification of intra- and extra-cellular fatty alcohols were performed as described in Example 2b. Under the conditions tested 14 mg/L of 1-hexadecanol was detected. Secreted fatty alcohols were not detected. Using 8% glycerol as carbon source, the total production and secretion of fatty alcohols was estimated to be ˜0.8 and 0.2 g/L, respectively. Fatty alcohols include: 30% C16:0 (1-hexahecanol), 56% 18:0 (1-octadecanol) and 12% C18:1 (cis Δ\n    9-1-octadecenol).\n    c.

When transformed with pCEN411, YL1415 strain showed 7-10-fold increase in fatty alcohol titer and a significant reduction in the rate of degradation of exogenous 1-hexadecanol in YPD media containing 8% glucose and 500 μg/mL hygromycin compared to that detected from \n    Y. lipolytica1345. Expression of \n    M. algicolaDG893 FAR was improved in the YL1415 strain by integrating the \n    M. algicolaDG893 FAR gene at random locations in the genome by non-homologous recombination. An integration cassette consisting of \n    M. algicolaFAR under control of the TEF promoter and the HygBR gene under control of the RPS promoter was amplified from pCEN411 using primers 411-F1 (AGAGACCGGGTTGGCGG) (SEQ ID NO: 17) and 411-R1 (CATTTGCCATTCGTAACGCTG) (SEQ ID NO: 18).\n    Transformation of YL1415 with this integration cassette yielded a library of hygromycin-resistant strains with FAR integrated at various locations in the \n    Y. lipolyticagenome [(Madzak, C. et al. (2003) \n    Yarrowia lipolytica. In G. Gellissen (Ed.), \n    Production of Recombinant Proteins Novel Microbial and Eukaryotic Expression Systems(p 163-189)]. This collection of strains with integrated \n    M. algicolaDG893 FAR in the YL1415 UV mutant strain was grown in 96-well Axygen 96-well plates containing 250 μL YPD supplemented with the total of 2% glucose and 500 μg/mL hygromycin. Plates were incubated in a Kuhner shaker for approximately 40-48 hours at 30° C., 200 rpm and 85% relative humidity. The cell cultures were diluted by transferring 50 μL of overnight grown cultures into the Axygen 96-well plates containing 250 μL YPD supplemented with the total of 2% glucose and 500 μg/mL hygromycin. The plates were incubated for approximately 24-28 hours in a Kuhner shaker under the similar conditions. 20 μL of the cell cultures were then transferred into deep 96-well plates containing 380 μL YPD supplemented with the total of 8% glucose and 500 μg/mL hygromycin. The Ppates were incubated for approximately 22-26 hours under similar conditions. Cells were collected by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 3500 rpm. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 400 μL of nitrogen limitation media (1.7 g/L yeast nitrogen base, 1.4 g/L (NH\n    4)\n    2SO\n    4, 30 g/L glucose) containing 500 μg/mL Hygromycin and incubated for 22-26 hours in a Kuhner shaker at 30° C., 200 rpm and 85% relative humidity. The cell cultures were then extracted with 1 mL of isopropanol:hexane (4:6 ratio) for 2 hrs. The extracts were centrifuged and the upper organic phase was transferred into polypropylene 96-well plates. Samples were then analyzed using GC-FID method as described in Example 2b. Under the conditions tested, \n    M. algicolaFAR integrant strains with up to ˜5× improvement in total fatty alcohol production (˜0.5-1 g/L) compared to plasmid-based expression were identified. Fatty alcohols include: 70-80% C16:0 (1-hexahecanol), 10-15% 18:0 (1-octadecanol) and 10-15% C18:1 (cis Δ\n    9-1-octadecenol).\n    All publications, patents, patent applications and other documents cited in this application are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties for all purposes to the same extent as if each individual publication, patent, patent application or other document were individually indicated to be incorporated by reference for all purposes.\n    While various specific embodiments have been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention(s).","lang":"en"}],"doc_number":"US20110000125","parent_case":[{"lang":"en"},{"text":"CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n    This application claims benefit of provisional application No. 61/221,934 filed Jun. 30, 2009 and provisional application No. 61/315,380 filed Mar. 18, 2010, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","lang":"en"},{"text":"CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n    This application claims benefit of provisional application No. 61/221,934 filed Jun. 30, 2009 and provisional application No. 61/315,380 filed Mar. 18, 2010, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","lang":"en"}],"ipc_classifications":[{"text":"C10L119"},{"text":"C12P764"},{"text":"C07H2100"},{"text":"C12N1563"},{"text":"C12N121"},{"text":"C12N119"},{"text":"C12N902"},{"text":"C12P500"},{"text":"C07C900"},{"text":"C09K300"}],"pub_numbers":[{"doc_number":"US20110000125"},{"doc_number":"20110000125"},{"doc_number":"US20110000125A1"}],"abstract":"The disclosure relates to methods of producing fatty alcohols from recombinant host cells comprising genes encoding heterologous fatty acyl-CoA reductase (FAR) enzymes.
